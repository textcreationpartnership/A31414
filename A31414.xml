            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>You will here meet with Perſons of your own Quality and Order, Men Great and Venerable, whoſe excellent Learning and exemplary Lives,
<pb facs="tcp:60969:5"/>whoſe Piety and Patience, Zeal and Charity, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and Contempt of the World, rendred them the honour of their Times, and recommend them as incomparable Examples to Poſterity. We may here ſee in more inſtances then one, the Epiſcopal Order immediately deriving it ſelf from <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> hands: whereof, were not ſome men ſtrangely biaſſed by Paſſion and Prejudice, there could be no ſhadow of diſpute. For he that can read the Lives of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Polycarp, &amp;c.</hi> and yet fancy them to have been no more then meer Pariſh-Prieſts, that only ſuperintended a little Congregation, muſt needs betray either prodigious Ignorance, or unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Partiality. Here alſo we may find what a mighty reverence theſe Firſt and better Ages had for the Governours of the Church, and the Guides of Souls, no reſpects being then thought great enough. Wherein they acted agreeably not onely to the Rules of Chriſtianity, but to the common ſenſe of mankind. And indeed with what Honours and Dignities, what Rights and Revenues, what Priviledges and Immunities the <hi>Sacred Function</hi> has been inveſted in all Ages and Nations, as well the rude and barbarous, as the more polite and civilized Countries, I could abundantly ſhew, were it as proper to this place as it is neceſſary to the Age we live in. For we are fallen into the worſt of Times, wherein men have been taught, by bad Principles and worſe Practices, to deſpiſe the holy Order, and to level it with the meaneſt of the People. And this done not onely by profeſt <hi>Enemies (for then
<pb facs="tcp:60969:5"/>we could have born it)</hi> but by pretended <hi>friends,</hi> who ſeem to have a high zeal for Religion and themſelves. By which means the hands of evil men have been ſtrengthened, and the deſigns of thoſe ſufficiently gratified, who 'tis like would rejoice at the ruine of us both. I confeſs that the Perſons and Credit of the Regular Clergy ſhould by ſome men be treated with Contempt and Scorn, is the leſs to be wondred at, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf is not ſecure from the rude and bold railleries of ſome, and the ſerious attempts of others, who gravely deſign to baniſh the awe of Religion, and the impreſſions of whatever is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Sacred out of the minds of men.</p>
                     <p>But, My Lord, It is not my deſign to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Lordſhip with an invective againſt the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of the Times. I had rather ſilently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail them, and heartily pray for their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the beſt of Churches may proſper and flouriſh under the beſt of Princes. May Her Peace and Order be preſerved inviolable, her Liturgy and Divine Offices univerſally complied with, Her Solemn Aſſemblies duly frequented, Her Canons and Conſtitutions obſerved and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed!

The firſt in this kind was <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great Prince
<pb facs="tcp:60969:7"/>and Legiſlator of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, who from the Creation of the World conveyed down the Records of above MMDL. years; the ſame courſe being more or leſs continued through all the periods of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State.

Theſe were the <hi>Annales Maximi,</hi> and afforded excellent materials to thoſe who afterwards wrote the Hiſtory of that great and powerful Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>But that which of all others challenges the greateſt regard both as it more immediately concerns the preſent enquiry, and as it contains accounts of things relating to our biggeſt intereſts, is the Hiſtory of the Church. For herein, as in a Glaſs, we have the true face of the Church in its ſeveral Ages repreſented to us. Here we find with what infinite care thoſe Divine Records, which are the great inſtruments of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, have through the ſeveral periods of time been conveyed down to us; with what a mighty ſucceſs Religion has triumphed over the greateſt oppoſitions, and ſpread its Banners in the remoteſt corners of the World. With how incomparable a zeal good men have <hi>contended earneſtly for that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> with what a bitter and implacable fury the Enemies of Religion have ſet upon it, and how ſignally the Divine Providence has appeared in
<pb facs="tcp:60969:7"/>its preſervation, and returned the miſchief upon their own heads. Here we ſee the conſtant ſucceſſion of Biſhops and the Miniſters of Religion in their ſeveral ſtations, <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious company of the Apoſtles, the goodly fellowſhip of the Prophets, the noble Army of Martyrs,</hi> who with the moſt chearful and compoſed minds have gone to Heaven through the acuteſt torments. In ſhort, we have here the moſt admirable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a divine and religious Life, of a real and unfeigned Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ſincere and univerſal Charity, a ſtrict Temperance and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, an unconquerable Patience and Submiſſion clearly repreſented to us. And the higher we go, the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious are the inſtances of Piety and Vertue. For however later Ages may have improved in knowledge, Experience daily making new additions to Arts and Sciences, yet former Times were moſt eminent for the practice and vertues of a holy life. The Divine Laws while newly publiſhed, had a ſtronger influence upon the minds of men, and the ſpirit of Religion was more active and vigorous, till men by degrees began to be debauched into that impiety and prophaneneſs, that in theſe laſt Times has over-run the World.</p>
                  <p>It were altogether needleſs and improper for me to conſider what Records there are of the ſtate of the Church before our Saviours Incarnation: it is ſufficient to my purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by what hands the firſt affairs of the Chriſtian Church have been tranſmitted to us. As for the Life and Death, the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour, and ſome of the firſt acts of his Apoſtles, they are fully repreſented by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Hiſtorians. Indeed immediately after them we meet with nothing of this nature,

'Tis true <hi>Euſebius</hi> takes no notice of that Council, but that might be partly becauſe he deſigned to end in that joyful and proſperous Scene of things, which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> reſtored to the Church (as he himſelf plainly intimates in the beginning of his Hiſtory,) which he was not willing to diſcompoſe with the controverſies and contentions of that Synod, according to the humour of all Hiſtorians, who delight to ſhut up their Hiſtories with ſome happy and ſucceſsful pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; and partly becauſe he intended to give ſome account of the affairs of that Council in his Book <hi>of the Life of Conſtantine the Great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Materials wherewith he was furniſhed for this great undertaking (which he complains were very ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable) were beſides <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> his <hi>Commentaries</hi> then extant, <hi>Africanus</hi> his <hi>Chronology,</hi> the Books and Writings of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fathers, the Records of particular Cities, Eccleſiaſtical

Upon this account a great and general out-cry has been made againſt <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes,</hi> as the Father of incredible Legends, and one that has notoriouſly impoſed upon the World by the moſt fabulous reports. Nay, ſome to reflect the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon him, have repreſented him as a petty Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. A charge, in my mind, raſh and inconſiderate, and in a great meaſure groundleſs and uncharitable. He was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of very conſiderable birth and fortunes, advanced to the higheſt Honours and Offices, one of the <hi>Primier</hi> Miniſters of State, and as is probable, <hi>Great Chancellor</hi> to the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> learned and eloquent above the common ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and who by the perſuaſions not onely of ſome great ones of that time (he flouriſhed under <hi>Leo the Wiſe</hi> about the Year DCCCC. but principally wrote under the reign of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor) but of the Emperour himſelf was prevailed with to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Lives of the Saints into order. To which end by his own infinite labour, and the no leſs expences of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he ranſacked the Libraries of the Empire, till he had amaſſed a vaſt heap of Volumes. The more ancient Acts he paſſed without any conſiderable alteration, more then the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
<pb facs="tcp:60969:9"/>them by a collation of ſeveral Copies, and the enlarging ſome circumſtances to render them more plain and eaſie, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing ſome that are extant at this day. Where Lives were confuſed and immethodical, or written in a ſtile rude and barbarous, he digeſted the hiſtory into order, and clothed it in more polite and elegant language. Others that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in neither, he left as they were, and gave them place amongſt his own. So that I ſee no reaſon for ſo ſevere a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, unleſs it were evident, that he took his accounts of things not from the Writings of thoſe that had gone before him, but forged them of his own head. Not to ſay that things have been made much worſe by Tranſlations, ſeldom appearing in any but the dreſs of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, and that many Lives are laid at his door, of which he never was the Father, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſual with ſome, when they met with the Life of a Saint, the Author whereof they knew not, preſently to faſten it upon <hi>Metaphraſtes.</hi> But to return to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> from whom we have digreſſed.</p>
                  <p>His Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, the almoſt onely remaining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the ancient Church, deſerves a juſt eſteem and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without which thoſe very fragments of Antiquity had been loſt, which by this means have eſcaped the common Shipwrack. And indeed S. <hi>Hierom, Nicephorus,</hi> and the reſt do not onely build upon his foundation, but almoſt entirely derive their materials from him. As for <hi>Socrates, Sozomen, Theodorit,</hi> and the later Hiſtorians, they relate to Times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the limits of my preſent buſineſs, generally conveying down little more then the Hiſtory of their own Times, the Church Hiſtory of thoſe more early Ages being either quite neglected, or very negligently managed. The firſt that to any purpoſe broke the ice after the Reformation, were the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> a combination of learned and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious men, the chief of whom were <hi>John Wigandus, Matth. Judex, Baſilius Faber, Andreas Corvinus,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Matth. Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> who was the very ſoul of the undertaking. They ſet themſelves to traverſe the Writings of the Fathers, and all the ancient Monuments of the Church, collecting whatever made to their purpoſe, which with indefatigable pains they digeſted into an Eccleſiaſtic Hiſtory. This they divided into <hi>Centuries,</hi> and each Century into fifteen Chapters, into each of which, as into its proper Claſſis and Repoſitory, they reduced whatever concerned the propagation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:60969:9"/>the Peace or Perſecutions of the Chriſtians, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church, and the Hereſies that aroſe in it, the Rites and Ceremonies, the Government, Schiſms, Councils, Biſhops, and perſons noted either for Religion or Learning, Heretics, Martyrs, Miracles, the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Religion of <hi>them that were without,</hi> and the political revolutions of that Age. A method accurate and uſeful, and which adminiſters to a very diſtinct and particular underſtanding the affairs of the Church. The four firſt Centuries were finiſhed in the City of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> the reſt elſewhere. A work of prodigious diligence and ſingular uſe. True it is, that it labours under ſome faults and imperfections, and is chargeable with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable errours and miſtakes.

And yet take it with all the faults and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages that can be charged upon it, and they bear no proportion to the uſefulneſs and excellency of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner did this work come abroad, but it made a loud noiſe and buſtle at <hi>Rome,</hi> as wherein the corruptions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of that Church were ſufficiently expoſed and laid open to the World. Accordingly it was neceſſary that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote ſhould be provided againſt it. For which purpoſe <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Nereus</hi> (who had lately founded the <hi>Oratorian Order at Rome</hi>) commands <hi>Baronius,</hi> then a very young man, and newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the <hi>Congregation,</hi> to undertake it, and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, daily to read nothing but Eccleſiaſtical Lectures in the Oratory. This courſe he held for thirty years together, ſeven ſeveral times going over the Hiſtory of the Church. Thus trained up, and abundantly furniſhed with fit materials, he ſets upon the Work it ſelf, which he diſpoſed by way of <hi>Annals,</hi> compriſing the affairs of whole Chriſtian World in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeries and ſucceſſion of every year. A method much more
<pb facs="tcp:60969:10"/>Natural and Hiſtorical then that of the <hi>Centuries.</hi> A noble deſign, and which it were injuſtice to defraud of its due praiſe and commendation, as wherein beſides whatever occurrences that concern the ſtate of the Church, reduced (as far as his skill in Chronology could enable him) under their proper periods, he has brought to light many paſſages of the Ancients, not known before, peculiarly advantaged herein by the many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Libraries that are at <hi>Rome.</hi> A Monument of incredible pains and labour, as which beſides the difficulties of the thing it ſelf, was entirely carried on by his ſingle endeavours, and written all with his own hand, and that too in the midſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite avocations, the diſtractions of a Pariſh-Cure, the private affairs of his own Oratory, Preaching, hearing Confeſſions, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting other Books, not to mention the many troubleſom, though honourable Offices and Imployments, which in the courſe of the Work were heaped upon him. In ſhort, a Work it was by which he had infinitely more obliged the World, then can be well expreſſed, had he managed it with as much faithfulneſs and impartiality as he has done with learning and induſtry. But alas, too evident it is, that he deſigned not ſo much the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Truth, as the honour and intereſt of a Cauſe, and therefore drew the face of the ancient Church, not as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity truly repreſents it, but according to the preſent form and complexion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> forcing everything to look that way, to juſtifie the traditions and practiſes, and to exalt the ſuper-eminent power and <hi>grandeur</hi> of that Church, making both the Scepter and the Croſier ſtoop to the Triple Crown.

This I then
<pb facs="tcp:60969:10"/>wholly laid aſide, without any further thoughts of re-aſſuming it. For experience had made me ſufficiently ſenſible of the difficulty of the thing, and I well foreſaw how almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it was to be managed to any tolerable ſatisfaction; ſo ſmall and inconſiderable, ſo broken and imperfect are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are left us of thoſe early times.

But I confeſs my humour and inclination led me to the firſt and beſt Ages of Religion, the <hi>Memoires</hi> whereof I have picked up, and thereby enabled my ſelf to draw the lineaments of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> perſons, as concerning whom I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive any conſiderable notices and accounts of things. With what ſucceſs, the Reader muſt judge: with whom what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment it will find, I know not, nor am I much ſollicitous. I have done what I could, and am not conſcious to my ſelf, that I have been wanting in any point either of Fidelity or Care. If there be fewer perſons here deſcribed then the ſpace of almoſt three hundred years may ſeem to promiſe, and leſs ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome of them then the Reader does expect, he will I preſume be more juſt and charitable, then to charge it upon me, but rather impute it to the unhappy fate of ſo many ancient Records as have been loſt through the careleſsneſs and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſucceeding Times. As far as my mean abilities do reach, and the nature of the thing will admit, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Readers ſatisfaction; and though I pretend not to preſent him an exact Church-Hiſtory of thoſe Times, yet I think I may without vanity aſſure him, that there is ſcarce any material paſſage of Church-Antiquity, of which in ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:60969:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe Lives he will not find a competent and reaſonable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Nor is the Hiſtory of thoſe Ages maimed and lame onely in its main limbs and parts, but (what is greatly to be bewailed) purblind and defective in its eyes, I mean, confuſed and uncertain in point of Chronology. The greateſt part of what we have is from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in whoſe account of Times ſome things are falſe, more uncertain, and the whole the worſe for paſſing through other hands after his. Indeed next to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the loſt portions of Antiquity, I know nothing would be more acceptable, then the ſetting right the disjointed Frame of thoſe Times: a Cure, which which we hope for ſhortly from a very able hand. In the mean time for my own part, and ſo far as may be uſeful to the purpoſes of the following Papers, I have by the beſt meaſures I could take in ſome haſt, drawn up a Chronology of theſe three Ages, which though it pretends not to the utmoſt exactneſs and accuracy that is due to a matter of this nature, yet it will ſerve however to give a quick and preſent proſpect of things, and to ſhew the connexure and concurrence of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs with the Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. So far as I follow <hi>Euſebius,</hi> I principally rely upon the accounts given in his Hiſtory, which being written after his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> may be ſuppoſed the iſſue of his more exact reſearches, and to have paſſed the judgment of his riper and more conſidering thoughts. And perhaps the Reader will ſay (and I confeſs I am ſomewhat of his mind) had I obſerved the ſame rule towards theſe Papers, he had never been troubled with them. But that is too late now to be recalled; and 'tis folly to bewail what is impoſſible to be remedied.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſtate of the Chriſtian Church in the three firſt Ages of it may be conſidered under a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold period: as it was firſt planted and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by our Lord himſelf during his reſidence in the World; as it was enlarged and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtles, and firſt Miſſionaries of the Chriſtian Faith; and as it grew up and proſpered from the Apoſtolic Age till the times of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> when the Empire ſubmitted it ſelf to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. God, who in former times was pleaſed by various methods of Revelation to convey his will to mankind, <hi>hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi> For the great bleſſing of the promiſed Seed after a long ſucceſſion of ſeveral Ages being come to its juſt maturity and perfection, God was reſolved <hi>to perform the mercy promiſed to the Fathers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his holy Covenant, the Oath which he ſware to our Father Abraham.</hi> Accordingly, <hi>In the fulneſs of time God ſent his Son.</hi> It was in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his reign, when this great Ambaſſador arrived from Heaven, to publiſh to the World the glad tidings of ſalvation. A period of time (as

                     <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves) wiſely ordered by the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being now in the higheſt pitch of its grandeur, all its parts united under a Monarchical Government, and an univerſal Peace ſpread over all the Provinces of the Empire, that had opened a way to a free and uninterrupted commerce with all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a ſmoother and ſpeedier paſſage was hereby prepared for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the doctrin of the Goſpel, which the Apoſtles and firſt Preachers of Religion might with the greater eaſe and ſecurity carry up and down to all quarters of the World. As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> their minds were awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened about this time with buſie expectations of their <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s coming: and no ſooner was the birth of the holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> proclaimed by the arrival of the <hi>Eaſtern Magi,</hi> who came to pay homage to him, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was filled with noiſe and tumult, the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was convened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by <hi>Herod,</hi> who jealous of his late gotten Soveraignty, was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to diſpatch this new Competitor out of the way. Deluded in his hopes of diſcovery by the <hi>Magi,</hi> he betakes himſelf to acts of open force and cruelty, commanding all Infants under two years old to be put to death, and among them it ſeems his own Son, which made

                     <hi>Auguſtus</hi> pleaſantly ſay (alluding to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom of abſtaining from Swines-fleſh) <hi>It is better to be Herods Hog then his Son.</hi> But the Providence of God ſecured the holy Infant, by timely admoniſhing his Parents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:60969:20"/>into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where they remained till the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> which happening not long after, they returned.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. NEAR thirty years our Lord remained obſcure under the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a private life, applying himſelf (as the Ancients tell us, and the Evangelical Hiſtory plainly intimates) to <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s imployment, the trade of a <hi>Carpenter.</hi> So little Patronage did he give to an idle unaccountable courſe of Life. But now he was called out of his Shades and Solitudes, and publicly owned to be that perſon, whom God had ſent to be the great Prophet of his Church. This was done at his Baptiſm, when the Holy Ghoſt in a viſible ſhape deſcended upon him, and God by an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice teſtified of him, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Accordingly he ſet himſelf to declare the Counſels of God, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about all Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom.</hi> He particularly explained the Moral Law, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to its juſt authority and dominion over the minds of men, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from thoſe corrupt and perverſe interpretations which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had put upon it. He next inſinuated the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Oeconomy, to which he was ſent to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, to enlarge the bounds of ſalvation, and admit both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> to terms of mercy: that he came as a Mediator between God and Man, to reconcile the World to the favour of Heaven by his death and ſufferings, and to propound pardon of ſin and eternal life to all that by an hearty belief, a ſincere repentance, and an holy life, were willing to embrace and entertain it. This was the ſum of the doctrin which he preached every where, as opportunity and occaſion led him, and which he did not impoſe upon the World meerly upon the account of his own authority and power, or beg a precarious entertainment of it; he did not tell men they muſt believe him, becauſe he ſaid he came from God, and had his Warrant and Commiſſion to inſtruct and reform the World, but gave them the moſt ſatisfactory and convictive evidence, by doing ſuch miracles as were beyond all powers and contrivances either of Art or Nature, whereby he unanſwerably demonſtrated, that <hi>he was a Teacher come from God, in that no man could do thoſe miracles which he did, except God were with him.</hi> And becauſe he himſelf was in a little time to return back to Heaven, he ordained <hi>twelve, whom he called Apoſtles,</hi> as his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Delegates and Vicegerents, to whom he deputed his authority and power, furniſhed them with miraculous gifts, and left them to carry on that excellent Religion which he himſelf had begun, to whoſe aſſiſtance he joined LXX Diſciples, as ordinary coadjutors and companions to them. Their Commiſſion for the preſent was limited to <hi>Paleſtin,</hi> and they ſent out onely <hi>to ſeek and to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p n="6">VI. IMMEDIATELY after our Lords Aſcenſion (from whence we date the next period of the Church) the Apoſtles began to execute the Powers intruſted with them. They preſently filled up <hi>Judas</hi> his vacancy by the election of a new Apoſtle, the <hi>lot falling upon Matthias, and he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles.</hi> Being next endued with power from on high (as our Lord had promiſed them) furniſhed with the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, they ſet themſelves to preach in places of the greateſt concourſe, and to the faces of their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They who but a while before fled at the firſt approach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, now boldly plead the cauſe of their crucified Maſter, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hazard of their lives. And that nothing might interrupt them in this imployment, they inſtituted the Office of <hi>Deacons,</hi> who might attend the inferiour Services of the Church while they devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to what was more immediately neceſſary to the good of ſouls. By which prudent courſe Religion got ground apace, and innumerable Converts were daily added to the Faith: till a Perſecution ariſing upon S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Martyrdom, baniſhed the Church out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though this alſo proved its advantage in the event and iſſue, Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means the ſooner ſpread up and down the neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

It may ſuffice to obſerve, that God was pleaſed to continue S. <hi>John</hi> to a very great age, beyond any of the reſt, that he might ſuperintend and cultivate, confirm and eſtabliſh what they had planted, and be as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That Chriſtianity from the nature of its precepts, the ſublimeneſs of its principles, its contrariety to the eſtabliſhed Rites and Religions of the World, was likely to find bad entertainment, and the fierceſt oppoſition, could not but be obvious to every impartial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer of things; which accordingly came to paſs. For it met with all the diſcouragement, the ſecret undermining, and open aſſaults which malice and prejudice, wit and parts, learning and power were able to make upon it.

And the triumph of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith will appear the more conſiderable, whether we regard the number and quality of its Converts, or the vaſt circumference to which it did extend and diffuſe it ſelf. Though it appeared under all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages to recommend it ſelf, yet no ſooner did it ſet up its Standard, but perſons from all parts, and of all kind of principles and educations began to flock to it, ſo admirably affecting very many both of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> (as <hi>Origen</hi>

THE ſhadows of the night do not more naturally vaniſh at the riſing of the Sun, than the darkneſs of Pagan Idolatry and Superſtition fled before the Light of the Goſpel; which the more it prevailed, the clearer it diſcovered the folly and impiety of their worſhip: Their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Rites appeared more trifling and ridiculous, their Sacrifices more barbarous and inhumane, their <hi>Daemons</hi> were expelled by the meaneſt Chriſtian, their Oracles became mute and ſilent, and their very Prieſts began to be aſhamed of their Magic Charms and Conjurations; and the more prudent and ſubtle heads among them, who ſtood up for the Rites and Solemnities of their Religion, were forced to turn them into myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and allegorical meanings, far enough either from the apprehenſion or intention of the vulgar. The truth is, the Devil, who for ſo many ages had uſurped an Empire and tyranny over the ſouls of men, became more ſenſible every day, that his Kingdom ſhaked; and therefore ſought, though in vain, by all ways to ſupport and prop it up.

And ſhould we only reckon up thoſe at which we our ſelves have been preſent and beheld, it may be it would only make the Infidels merry; ſuppoſing that we like themſelves did forge and feign them.

THE troubleſome viciſſitudes and revolutions of affairs that hapned under the ſucceeding Emperors, <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius;</hi> and the mild and merciful diſpoſition of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> gave ſome reſt to the Chriſtians: till <hi>Domitian</hi> ſucceeding, began a SECOND PERSECUTION. A man of a temper vaſtly different from that of his Father, and his Brother; for though at firſt he put on a plauſible carriage, yet he ſoon left off the <hi>vizor,</hi> and appeared like himſelf; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and unactive, ill-natur'd and ſuſpicious, griping and covetous, proud and inſolent: yea, ſo vainly ambitious as to affect Divinity, in all public Edicts aſſuming to himſelf, and in all Petitions and Addreſſes requiring from others the titles of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> He never truly loved any man; and when he moſt pretended it, it was a ſure ſign of that mans ruine. His cruelty he exercis'd firſt upon flies, thouſands whereof he diſpatched every day; next upon men, and thoſe of all ranks and ſtates: putting to death the moſt illuſtrious Senators, and perſons of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour and nobility upon the moſt trifling pretences; and many times for no cauſe at all. In the fierceneſs and brutality of his temper he equall'd <hi>Nero, Portio Neronis de crudelitate,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſtiles him;
<note place="margin">Loc. ſuper. citat.</note> nay, in this exceeded him: that <hi>Nero</hi> was content to command execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be done at a diſtance, while <hi>Domitian</hi> took pleaſure in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cruelties exerciſed before his eyes: An argument of a temper deeper died in blood. But the Chriſtians, alas, bore the heavieſt load of his rage and malice, whom he every where perſecuted either by death or baniſhment. Under him S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Rome,</hi> and by his command thrown into a Cauldron of boiling oil: in the midſt whereof, when the Divine Providence had miraculouſly preſerved him, he immediately baniſhed him into <hi>Patmos.</hi> He put to death his couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german <hi>Fl.

Domitilla</hi> (his own kinſwoman alſo) upon the ſame account into the Iſland <hi>Pandataria.</hi> At length his brutiſh and bloody practices rendred him intolerable to his own friends and ſervants, who conſpir'd againſt him (his own Wife <hi>Domitia</hi> being of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy) and ſlew him. His ſucceſſor <hi>Nerva</hi> abrogated his Acts, and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe whom he had proſcribed and baniſhed; among whom S. <hi>John</hi> taking the benefit of that <hi>Act</hi> of Revocation, quitted <hi>Patmos,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Epheſus.</hi>

A Prince he was of excellent and incomparable virtues, whoſe juſtice and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, gentleneſs and modeſty, munificence and liberality, kindneſs and affability rendred him infinitely dear and acceptable to the people; the extravagancies of his Predeceſſors not a little contributing to ſweeten his Government to them. He was mild and diſ-paſſionate, familiar and courteous; he ſhewed a great reverence to the Senate, by whoſe advice he uſually acted; and they to requite him, gave him the title of <hi>Optimus,</hi> as whom they judged the beſt of all their Princes. He converſed freely and innocently with all men, being deſirous rather to be beloved, than

The glory of all which is exceedingly ſtain'd in the Records of the Church by his ſevere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Chriſtians.

                           <hi>IT is my cuſtom,</hi> Sir, <hi>in all affairs wherein I doubt, to have recourſe to you. For who can better either ſway my irreſolution, or inſtruct my ignorance? I have never been heretofore preſent at the examination and trial of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and therefore know not what the crime is, and how far it is wont to be puniſhed, or how to proceed in theſe enquiries. Nor was I a little at a loſs, whether regard be to be had to difference of age, whether the young and the weak be to be diſtinguiſhed from the more ſtrong and aged? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place may be allowed to repentance, and it may be of any advantage to him, who once was a Chriſtian, to ceaſe to be ſo? Whether the name alone without other offences, or the offences that go along with the name, ought to be puniſhed? In the mean time towards thoſe who as Chriſtians have been brought before me, I have taken this courſe; I asked them whether they were Chriſtians? if they confeſsed it, I asked them once and again, threatning puniſhment; if they perſiſted, I commanded them to be executed. For, I did not at all doubt but that, whatever their confeſſion was, their ſtubbornneſs and inflexible obſtinacy ought to be puniſhed. Others there were guilty of the like madneſs, whom becauſe they were</hi> Roman <hi>Citizens, I adjudged to be tranſmitted to</hi> Rome. <hi>While things thus proceeded, the error, as is uſual, ſpreading farther, more caſes did enſue. A nameleſs</hi> Libel <hi>was preſented, containing the names of many who denied themſelves to to be, or to have been Chriſtians. Theſe, when after my example they invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the gods, and offered Wine and Incenſe to your Statue (which for that purpoſe I had commanded to be brought together with the images of the gods) and had moreover blaſphemed Chriſt (which its ſaid none that are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can be compelled to do) I diſmiſs'd; others mentioned in the</hi> Libel <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves Chriſtians, but preſently denied it, that they had indeed been ſuch, but had renounced it; ſome by the ſpace of three years, others many years ſince, and one five and twenty years ago. All which paid their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and veneration to your Statue, and the images of the gods, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed Chriſt. They affirmed that the whole ſum of that Sect or error lay in this, that they were wont upon a ſet ſolemn day to meet together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-riſe, and to ſing among themſelves a Hymn to Chriſt, as the God whom they worſhipped, and oblige themſelves by an Oath, not to commit any wickedneſs, but to abſtain from Theft, Robbery, Adultery, to keep Faith, and when required, to reſtore any pledge intruſted with them. Which done, then to depart for that time, and to meet again at a common meal, to partake of a promiſcuous and harmleſs food; which yet they laid aſide, after I had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an Edict, forbidding, according to your order, the</hi> Heteriae <hi>(or unlawful Aſſemblies) to be kept. To ſatisfie my ſelf in the truth hereof, I commanded two Maidens called</hi> Deaconeſſes, <hi>to be examined upon the Wrack. But I perceived nothing but a lewd and immoderate Superſtition, and therefore ſurceaſing any farther proceſs, I have ſent to pray your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: For the caſe ſeemed to me very worthy to be conſulted about; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering the great numbers that are in danger: for very many of all ages and ranks, both men and women are, and will be called in queſtion: the contagion of this Superſtition having over-ſpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A long peace and proſperity (for except a little diſturbance in the time of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> they met with no oppoſition through the reigns of <hi>Gallienus, Claudius, Tacitus, Florianus, Probus, Carus,</hi> and <hi>Numerian</hi>) had ſomewhat corrupted the manners of Chriſtians, and therefore God was pleaſed to permit a TENTH PERSECUTION to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to purge and winnow the rubbiſh and the chaff: the Ulcer began to putrifie, and it was time to call for the Knife and the Cauſtic. It began under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and his Colleague <hi>Maximian. Diocleſian</hi> was a Prince active and diligent, crafty and ſubtil, fierce in his nature, but which he knew how cunningly to diſſemble. His zeal for the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him with all poſſible earneſtneſs to oppoſe Chriſtianity, which he carried on with a high hand, it being as the laſt, ſo the fierceſt Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like the laſt efforts of a dying enemy, that ſummons all his ſtrength to give the parting blow. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> then reſiding at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> publiſhed his Edicts about the very ſolemnity of our Saviours Paſſion, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chriſtian Churches to be pulled down, their Bibles to be burnt, the better ſort of them to be branded with infamy, the vulgar to be made ſlaves; as by ſubſequent orders he commanded the Biſhops to be every where impriſoned, and forced to Sacrifice. But theſe were but a <hi>praeludium</hi> to what followed after, other Proclamations being put forth, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that refus'd to offer Sacrifice to be expos'd to all manner of torments. 'Twere endleſs to reckon up particular perſons that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this evil time. <hi>Euſebius</hi> who liv'd under this very Perſecution, has recorded a vaſt number of them, with the Acts of their Martyrdom; too many to account for in this place. It may ſuffice to note from him, that they were ſcourged to death, had their fleſh torn off with pincers, or rak'd off with pieces of broken pots, were caſt to Lions and Tygers, to wild Boars and Bears, provoked and enrag'd with fire to ſet upon them, burnt, beheaded, crucified, thrown into the Sea, torn in pieces by the diſtorted boughs of Trees, or their legs miſerably diſtended in the Stocks, roaſted at a gentle fire, or by holes made on purpoſe had melted lead poured into their bowels. But impoſſible it is to conceive, much more to expreſs the cruelties of that time. <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf who ſaw them, tells

All which he aſſures they endured with the moſt admirable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted patience; they throng'd to the Tribunals of their Judges, and freely told them what they were; deſpis'd the threatnings and barbarity of their enemies, and received the fatal and decretory Sentence with a ſmile; when perſuaded to be tender of their lives, and to compaſſionate the caſe of their Wives and Children, they bore up againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a manly and Philoſophic mind, <gap reason="foreign">

THUS we have ſeen the hardſhips and miſeries, the torments and ſufferings which the Chriſtians were expoſed to for ſeveral ages, and with how invincible a patience they went through with them. Let us now a little review the argument, and ſee what force and influence it had to convince the world of the truth of their Religion, and bring in Converts to the Faith. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apolog. c. ult. p.</hi> 40.</note> tells the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 
                     <q>That all their cruelty was to no purpoſe, that it was but a ſtronger invitation to bring over others to the party; that the oftner they mowed them down, the faſter they ſprang up again; and that the blood of Chriſtians was a ſeed that grew up into a more plentiful harveſt; that ſeveral among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had exhorted their auditors to patience under ſuffering, but could never make ſo many Proſelytes with all their fine diſcourſes, as the Chriſtians did by their actions: that that very obſtinacy which was ſo much charged upon them was a tutor to inſtruct others. For who when they beheld ſuch things, could not but be powerfully mov'd to enquire what really was within? who when he had once found it, would not embrace it? and having once embraced it, not be deſirous to ſuffer for it; that ſo he may obtain the full Grace of God, and the pardon of his ſins aſſured by the ſhedding of his blood.</q> 
                     <hi>Lactantius</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>De Juſtit. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 494.</note> mannages this argument with incomparable eloquence and ſtrength of reaſon: his diſcourſe is ſomewhat long, but not unworthy the Readers conſideration. <q>Since our number <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is always increaſed from amongſt the Votaries of the Heathen deities, and is never leſſened, no not in the hotteſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, who is ſo blind and ſtupid, as not to ſee in which party true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does reſide? But they, alas, are blinded with rage and malice, and think all to be fools, who when 'tis in their power to eſcape puniſhment, chuſe rather to be tortured and to die; when as they might perceive by this, that that can be no ſuch folly, wherein ſo many thouſands throughout the whole world do ſo unanimouſly conſpire. Suppoſe
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:60969:34"/>women through the weakneſs of their Sex may miſcarry (and they are pleaſed ſometimes to ſtyle this Religion an <hi>effeminate</hi> and <hi>old-wives Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi>) yet certainly men are wiſer. If children and young men may be raſh, yet at leaſt thoſe of a mature age and old men have a more ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment. If one City might play the fool, yet innumerable others cannot be ſuppoſed to be guilty of the ſame folly. If one Province, or one Nation ſhould want care and providence, yet all the reſt cannot lack underſtanding to judge what is right. But now when the Divine Law is entertain'd from the riſing of the Sun, to the going down thereof, and every Sex, Age, Nation and Country ſerves God with one heart and Soul; when there is every where the ſame patience, and contempt of death, they ought to conſider that there is ſome reaſon for it, and that it is not without cauſe, that it is maintained even unto death: that there is ſome fixed foundation when a Religion is not only not ſhattered by injuries and perſecutions, but always increaſed and rendred more firm and ſtable. When the very common people ſee men torn in pieces by various engins of torment, and yet maintain a patience unconquerable in the midſt of their tir'd tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors; they cannot but think what the truth is, that the conſent of ſo many, and their perſeverance unto death, cannot be in vain, nor that patience it ſelf, without the Divine aſſiſtance, ſhould be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch exquiſit tortures. High-way men and perſons of the moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt conſtitutions are not able to bear ſuch pulling aſunder; they roar, and groan, and ſink under pain, becauſe not furniſhed with a Divine patience. But our very children (to ſay nothing of our men) and our tender women, do by ſilence conquer their tormentors; nor can the flames extort one ſigh from them. Let the <hi>Romans</hi> go now, and boaſt of their <hi>Mutius</hi> and their <hi>Regulus,</hi> one of which delivered up himſelf to be put to death by his enemies, becauſe he was aſhamed to live a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; the other thruſt his hand into the fire when he ſaw he could not eſcape death. Behold, with us the weaker Sex, and the more delicate age ſuffers the whole body to be torn and burnt; not becauſe they could not avoid it if they would, but voluntarily, becauſe they truſt in God. This is true virtue, which Philoſophers in vain only talk of, when they tell us, that nothing is ſo ſuitable to the gravity and conſtancy of a wiſe man, as not by any terrors to be driven from his ſentiments and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that it is vertuous, and great indeed, to be tortur'd and die, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than betray ones Faith, or be wanting in his duty, or do any thing that's unjuſt or diſhoneſt, though for fear of death, or the acuteſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs they thought their own Poet rav'd, when he ſaid,</q>

                  <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Chriſtian Religion being deſigned by God for the reformation of Mankind, and the rooting out that Barbariſm and Idolatry wherewith the World was ſo over-grown, could not but meet with oppoſition, all corrupt Intereſts conſpiring to give it no very welcom entertainment. Vice and Errour had too long uſurped the Throne, to part with it by a tame and eaſie reſignation, but would rather ſummon all their Forces againſt a Doctrin, that openly proclaimed the ſubverſion and ruine of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Hence <hi>this Sect was every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> equally oppoſed both by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> deſpiſed it for its lateneſs and novelty, as having no antiquity to recommend it, nor could they endure that their Philoſophy, which then every where ruled the Chair, ſhould be controlled by a plain ſimple Doctrine, that pretended to no elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Schemes, no inſinuative ſtrains of Eloquence, no nice and ſubtile arts of Reaſoning, no abſtruſe and ſublime Speculations. The <hi>Jews</hi> were vexed to ſee their expectations of a mighty Prince who ſhould greatly exalt their State, and redeem it from that oppreſſion and ſlavery under which it groaned, fruſtrated by the coming of a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under all the circumſtances of meanneſs and diſgrace; and who was ſo far from reſcuing them from the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, that for their obſtinacy and unbelief he threatned the final and irrevocable ruine of their Countrey, and by the Doctrine he publiſhed plainly told them he intended to aboliſh thoſe ancient <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitutions, for which they had ſuch dear regards, and ſo ſolemn a Veneration. Accordingly when he came amongſt them, they entertained him with all the inſtances of cruelty and contempt, and whatever might expoſe him to the ſcorn and <hi>odium</hi> of the People; they vilified and reproached his perſon, as but the ſon of a Carpenter, a Glutton and a Drunkard, a Traitor and an <hi>Enemy unto Caeſar;</hi> they ſleighted his Doctrine as the talk onely of a rude and illiterate perſon, traduced his Miracles as tricks of Impoſture, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60969:36"/>the effects of a black Confederacy with the infernal Powers. And when all this would not do, they violently laid hands upon him, and took away his life. And now one would have thought their ſpite and fury ſhould have cooled and died: but malice and revenge are too fierce and hot to ſtop at the firſt attempt. On they reſolve to go in theſe bloody methods, and to let the World ſee that the Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers muſt expect no better then their Maſter, it was not many Moneths before they took occaſion to refreſh their rage in St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: the Hiſtory of whoſe Life and Death we now come to relate, and to make ſome brief Remarks upon it.</p>

THE peace and quiet of the Church being by this means a little ruffled and diſcompoſed, the Apoſtles, who well underſtood how much Order and Unity conduced to the ends of Religion, preſently called the Church together, and told them, that the diſpoſing of the Common Stock, and the daily providing for the neceſſities of the Poor, however conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and neceſſary, was yet a matter of too much trouble and diſtraction to conſiſt with a faithful diſcharge of the other parts and duties of their Office, and that they did not judge it fit and reaſonable to neglect the one, that they might attend the other; that therefore they ſhould chuſe out among themſelves ſome that were duly qualified, and preſent them to them, that they might ſet them apart peculiarly to ſuperintend this affair, that ſo themſelves being freed from theſe incumbrances, might the more freely and uninterruptedly devote themſelves to prayer and preaching of the Goſpel. Not that the Apoſtles thought the care of the Poor an Office too much below them, but that this might be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by other hands, and they, as they were obliged, the better attend upon things of higher importance, Miniſteries more immediately ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the ſouls of men.

THE Court being thus ſet, and the Charge brought in and opened, that nothing might be wanting to carry on their mock Scene of Juſtice, they give him liberty to defend himſelf. In order whereunto while the Judges of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> earneſtly lookt upon him, they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the appearances of an extraordinary ſplendor and brightneſs upon his face, the innocency of his cauſe and the clearneſs of his conſcience manifeſting themſelves in the brightneſs and chearfulneſs of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The High-prieſt having asked him whether guilty or not, he in a large diſcourſe pleaded his own cauſe to this effect: <q>That what apprehenſions ſoever they might have of the ſtatelineſs and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their Temple, of the glory and <hi>grandeur</hi> of its ſervices and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, of thoſe venerable cuſtoms and uſages that were amongſt them, as if they looked upon them as indiſpenſably neceſſary, and that 'twas blaſphemy to think, God might be acceptably ſerved without them; yet that if they looked back to the firſt originals of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would find, that God choſe <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Father and Founder of it, not when he lived in a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and worſhipped God with the pompous ſervices of a Temple, but when he dwelt among the Idolatrous Nations: that then it was that God called him from the impieties of his Fathers houſe, and admitted him to a familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and intercourſe with himſelf; wherein he continued for many years without any of thoſe external and viſible Rites which they laid ſo much ſtreſs upon; and that when at laſt God entered into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, to give his poſterity the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that in <hi>his ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> he bound it upon him with no other ceremony, but onely that of Circumciſion, as the Badge and Seal of that foederal compact that was between them: that without any other fixed Rite but this, the ſucceeding Patriarchs worſhipped God for ſeveral Ages, till the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a wiſe, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and prudent perſon, to whom God particularly revealed himſelf, and appointed him Ruler over his People, to conduct them out of the Houſe of Bondage, a great and famous Prophet, and who was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually inculcating this Leſſon to their Anceſtors, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear;</hi> that is, that God in the latter days would ſend amongſt them a mighty Prophet, who ſhould do as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done, introduce new Rites, and ſet up more excellent Inſtitutions and ways of Worſhip, to whom they ſhould yield all diligent attention, and ready obedience:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60969:41"/>that when their fore-fathers had frequently lapſed into Idolatry, God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet up a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> as a place of publick and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip, where he would manifeſt himſelf, and receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and adorations of his People; which yet however was but a tranſient and temporary miniſtration, and though erected by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate order of God himſelf, was yet after ſome years to give place to a ſtanding Temple deſigned by <hi>David,</hi> but built by <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed and majeſtick, but not abſolutely neceſſary, ſeeing that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being that made the World, who <hi>had the heaven for his throne, and the earth for his footſtool,</hi> could not be confined within a material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor tied to any particular way of worſhip; and that therefore there could be no ſuch abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity for thoſe <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, as they pretended; eſpecially when God was reſolved to introduce a new and better Scene and ſtate of things. But it was the humour of this looſe and unruly, this refractory and undiſciplinable generation, (as it ever had been of their Anceſtors) to <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and oppoſe him in all thoſe methods, whereby he ſought to reform and reclaim them; that there were few of the Prophets whom their fore-fathers had not perſecuted, and ſlain them that had foretold the <hi>Meſſia's</hi> coming, the <hi>juſt and the holy Jeſus,</hi> as they their unhappy poſterity had actually betrayed and murdered him, without any due reverence and regard to that <hi>Law,</hi> which had been ſolemnly delivered to them by the miniſtry of Angels, and which he came to fulfil and perfect.</q>

THE holy man was going on in the Application, when the patience of his Auditors, which had hitherto holden out, at this began to fail; that fire which gently warms at a diſtance, ſcorches when it comes too near; their conſciences being ſenſibly ſtung by the too near approach of the truths he delivered, they began to fume and fret, and expreſs all the ſigns of rage and fury.

The good man was infinitely raviſhed with the Viſion, and it inſpired his ſoul with a freſh zeal and courage, and made him long to arrive at that happy place, and little concerned what uſe they would make of it; he could not but communicate and impart his happineſs; the Cup was full, and it eaſily overflowed; he tells his adverſaries what himſelf beheld, <hi>Behold, I ſee the heavens opened, and the ſon of man ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi>

How furious and impatient is miſ-guided Zeal! they did not ſtand to procure a Warrant from the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour (without whoſe leave they had not power to put any man to death) nay they had not the patience to ſtay for the judicial ſentence of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60969:42"/>acted the part of <hi>Zealots,</hi> (who were wont to execute vengeance upon Capital Offenders without ſtaying for the ordinary formalities of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) and raiſing a great noiſe and clamour, and <hi>ſtopping their ears,</hi> that they might hear no further blaſphemies, and be deaf to all cries for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they unanimouſly ruſhed upon him. But Zeal is ſuperſtitious in its maddeſt fury: they would not execute him within the Walls, leſt they ſhould pollute the holy City with his blood, but hurried him <hi>without the City,</hi> and there fell upon him with a ſhower of ſtones. Stoning was one of the four Capital puniſhments among the <hi>Jews,</hi> inflicted upon greater and more enormous crimes, eſpecially Blaſphemy, Idolatry, and ſtrange Worſhip:

The Malefactor was to be led out of the Conſiſtory, at the door whereof a perſon was to ſtand with a Napkin in his hand, and a man on Horſe-back at ſome diſtance from him, that if any one came and ſaid, he had ſomething to offer for the deliverance of the Malefactor, upon the moving of the Napkin the Horſeman might give notice, and bring the offender back. He had two grave perſons to go along with him to exhort him to confeſſion by the way; a Crier went before him, proclaiming who he was, what his crime, and who the Witneſſes; being come near the place of execution (which was two cubits from the ground) he was firſt ſtripped, and then ſtoned, and afterwards hanged, where he was to continue till Sun-ſet, and then being taken down, he and his Gibbet were both buried together.</p>

WHAT the judicious and unprejudiced Reader will think of theſe and more the like inſtances there reported by this good Father, I know not, or whether he will not think it reaſonable to believe, that God might ſuffer theſe ſtrange and miraculous cures to be wrought in a place where multitudes yet perſiſted in their <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> and infidelity,
<note place="margin">Vid. Aug. loc. cit. initio cap.</note> and who made this one great objection againſt the Chriſtian Faith, that whatever miracles might be heretofore pretended for the confirmation of Chriſtian Religion, yet that now they were ceaſed, when yet they were ſtill neceſſary to induce the World to the belief of Chriſtianity. Certain it is, that nothing was done herein, but what did very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the wiſdom and the goodneſs of God, who as he is never wont to be prodigal in multiplying the effects of his omnipotent power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a juſt neceſſity, ſo is never wanting to afford all neceſſary eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and methods of conviction. That therefore the unbelieving World (who made this the great refuge of their infidelity) might ſee that his arm was not grown effoete and weak, that he had not left the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion wholly deſtitute of immediate and miraculous atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was pleaſed to exert theſe extraordinary powers, that he might baffle their unbelief, and ſilence their objections againſt the divinity of the Chriſtian Faith. And for this reaſon God never totally withdrew the power of working Miracles from the Church, till the World was in a manner wholly ſubdued to the faith of Chriſt. And then he left it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60969:45"/>to be conducted by more humane and regular ways, and to preſerve its Authority over the minds of men by thoſe ſtanding and innate chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Divinity, which he has impreſſed upon it. 'Tis true that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill pretends to this power, which it endeavours to juſtifie by appealing to theſe and ſuch like inſtances. But in vain, and to no purpoſe; the pretended miracles of that Church being generally trifling and ludicrous, far beneath that gravity and ſeriouſneſs that ſhould work upon a wiſe and conſidering mind, the manner of their operation obſcure and ambiguous, their numbers exceſſive and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, the occaſions of them light and frivolous, and after all, the things themſelves for the moſt part falſe, and the reports very often ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and extravagant, as would choke any ſober and rational belief, ſo that a man muſt himſelf become the greateſt miracle that believes them. I ſhall obſerve no more, then that in all theſe caſes related by S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> we never find that they invocated or prayed to the Martyr, nor begged to be healed by his merits or interceſſion, but immediately directed their addreſſes to God himſelf.</p>

But whoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the one was an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and one of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> the other a <hi>Deacon</hi> onely, and one of the <hi>Seven,</hi> choſen out of the People, and ſet apart by the Apoſtles, that they themſelves might attend the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Miniſteries of their Office, that the one was diſperſed up and down the Countrey, while the other remained with the Apoſtolical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the one though commiſſionated to Preach and to Baptize, could not impart the Holy Ghoſt (the peculiar prerogative of the Apoſtolical Office) will ſee juſt reaſon to force him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a vaſt difference between them. Our S. <hi>Philip</hi> was one of the <hi>Seventy</hi> Diſciples, and S. <hi>Stephens</hi> next Colleague in the Deacons Office, erected for the conveniency of the Poor, and aſſiſting the Apoſtles in ſome inferiour Services and Miniſtrations: which ſhews him to have been a perſon of great eſteem and reputation in the Church, endowed with miraculous powers, <hi>full of Wiſdom, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which were the qualifications required by the Apoſtles in thoſe who were to be conſtituted to this place. In the diſcharge of this Miniſtery he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ſome moneths after his election, till the Church being ſcattered up and down, he was forced to quit his ſtation: as what wonder if the Stewards be diſmiſſed, when the Houſhold is broken up?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Protomartyr</hi> had been lately ſacrificed to the rage and fury of his Enemies: but the bloudy Cloud did not ſo blow over, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a blacker tempeſt. Cruelty and revenge never ſay it is enough, like the temper of the Devil, whoſe malice is inſatiable and eternal. <hi>Stephens</hi> death would not ſuffice, the whole Church is now ſhot at, and they reſolve (if poſſible) to extirpate the Religion it ſelf. The great Engineer in this Perſecution was <hi>Saul,</hi> whoſe active and fiery genius, and paſſionate concern for the Traditions of the Fathers, made him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the deſign with the Spirit of a <hi>Zealot,</hi> and the rage of a Mad-man. Having furniſhed himſelf with a Commiſſion from the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> he quickly put it in execution, broke open Houſes, ſeized whoever he met
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60969:47"/>with, that looked but like a Diſciple of the crucified <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and without any regard to Sex or Age, beat, and haled them unto priſon, plucking the Husband from the boſom of his Wife, and the Mother from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of her Children, blaſpheming God, proſecuting and being inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto men, breathing out nothing but ſlaughter and threatnings where-ever he came;

The Church by this means was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire, the Apoſtles onely remaining privately at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they might the better ſuperintend and ſteer the affairs of the Church, while the reſt were diſperſed up and down the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, publiſhing the glad tidings of the Goſpel, and declaring the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign of it in all places where they came; ſo that what their Enemies intended as the way to ruine them, by breaking the knot of their Fellowſhip and Society, proved an effectual means to enlarge the bounds of Chriſtianity. Thus excellent perfumes, while kept cloſe in a box, few are the better for them, whereas being once, whether caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or maliciouſly ſpilt upon the ground, the fragrant ſcent preſently fills all corners of the houſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. AMONG them that were thus diſperſed was our <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> ſo ſtiled not from his Writing, but preaching of the Goſpel. He dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his journey towards the Province of <hi>Samaria, and came into a City of Samaria</hi> (as thoſe words may be read) probably <hi>Gitton,</hi> the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> though it's ſafeſt to underſtand it of <hi>Samaria</hi> it ſelf.

<note place="margin">Joh. 4.9.</note> Hence the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman wondred, that our Lord <hi>being a Jew, ſhould ask drink of her, who was a Woman of Samaria; for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</hi> They deſpiſed them at the rate of Heathens, devoted them under the moſt ſolemn execrations, allowed them not to become Proſelytes, nor to have any Portion in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, ſuffered not an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to eat with them, no nor to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their Bleſſing, nor did they think they could faſten upon our Saviour a greater Character of reproach, then to ſay that he was a <hi>Samaritan, and had a Devil.</hi> But God regards not the prejudices of men, nor always with-holds his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them, whom we are ready to baniſh the Lines of Love and Friendſhip. 'Tis true the Apoſtles at their firſt miſſion were charged <hi>not to go in the way of the Gentiles,

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60969:48"/>preached the Goſpel to theſe <hi>Samaritans,</hi> ſo odious, ſo diſtaſtful to the <hi>Jews:</hi> to which he effectually prepared his way by many great and uncontrollable miracles, which being arguments fitted to the capacities, and accommodate to the ſenſes of the meaneſt, do eaſilieſt convey the truth into the minds of men. And the ſucceſs here was accordingly, the people generally embracing the Chriſtian Doctrine, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him curing all manner of diſeaſes, and powerfully diſpoſſeſſing <hi>daemons,</hi> who with great horror and regret were forced to quit their reſidence, to the equal joy and wonder of that place.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. IN this City was one <hi>Simon,</hi> born at a Town not far off, who by Sorcery and <hi>Magic</hi> Arts had ſtrangely inſinuated himſelf into the reverence and veneration of the People.

And in this caſe things ſtood at S. <hi>Philips</hi> arrival, whoſe greater and more unqueſtionable miracles quickly turned the Scale. Impoſture cannot bear the too near approach of Truth, but flies before it, as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs vaniſhes at the preſence of the Sun. The People ſenſible of their errour, univerſally flocked to S. <hi>Philips</hi> Sermons, and convinced by the efficacy of his Doctrine, and the power of his Miracles, gave up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Converts, and were by Baptiſm initiated into the Chriſtian Faith: Yea the <hi>Magician</hi> himſelf aſtoniſhed at thoſe mighty things which he ſaw done by <hi>Philip,</hi> profeſſed himſelf his Proſelyte and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was baptized by him; being either really perſuaded by the convictive evidence of Truth, or elſe for ſome ſiniſter deſigns craftily diſſembling his Belief and Profeſſion of Chriſtianity.

The Son of God has appeared in the Countrey of <hi>Judaea,</hi> promiſing eternal life to all that are willing to embrace it, and to lead their lives according to the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſent him. Wherefore change your courſe of life, and turn from a worſe to a better ſtate, from things temporal to thoſe that are eternal. Acknowledge that there is one onely God, who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whoſe world you unjuſtly poſſeſs before his righteous face. But if you reform, and live according to his Laws, you ſhall be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into another World, where you ſhall become immortal, and enjoy the ineffable glories and happineſs of that ſtate. Whereas if you perſiſt in your infidelity, your ſouls after the diſſolution of theſe bodies, ſhall be caſt into a place of flames, where they ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally tormented under the anguiſh of an unprofitable and too late Repentance.

And this again is the moſt divine knowledge of God, that which is known by ignorance, according to the union that is above underſtanding; when the mind getting at a diſtance from all things that are, and having diſmiſſed it ſelf, is united to thoſe ſuper-illuſtrious Beams, from whence and where it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in the unfathomable depth of wiſdom.</hi> More of this and the like ſtuff is plentifully ſcattered up and down theſe Books.

                     <hi>S. Clemens</hi> grew up in all manly Studies, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, till falling under ſome great diſſatisfactions of mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immortality of the ſoul, and the ſtate of the other life, he applied himſelf to ſearch more narrowly into the nature and the truth of things. After having baffled all his own notions, he betook himſelf to the Schools of the Philoſophers, where he met with nothing but fierce contentions, endleſs diſputes, ſophiſtical and uncertain arts of reaſoning; thence he reſolved to conſult the <hi>Egyptian Hierophantae,</hi> and to ſee if he could meet with any who by arts of <hi>Magic</hi> was able to fetch back one of thoſe who were departed to the inviſible World, the very ſight of whom might ſatisfie his curious enquiries about this matter. While he was under this ſuſpenſe, he heard of the Son of God his appearing in the world, and the excellent doctrins he had publiſhed in <hi>Judaea,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was further inſtructed by the miniſtry of S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome.</hi> Him he followed firſt to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thence after a little time to <hi>Judaea.</hi> Arriving at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> he met with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> by whom he was inſtructed and baptized, whoſe Companion and Diſciple he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for a great part of his life.</p>

At which time <hi>Clemens,</hi> whom <hi>S.

As for a more diſtinct and particular account of the Times, I thus compute them: <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom in the <hi>Neronian</hi> perſecution (as we have elſewhere probably ſhewed) <hi>Ann.</hi> LXV.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60969:75"/>moneths, and eleven days, which between them make XXV years, and extend to <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> XC. after which if we add the nine years, eleven moneths, and twelve days, wherein <hi>Clemens</hi> ſate ſole Biſhop over that whole Church, they fall in exactly with the third year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> the time aſſigned for his Martyrdom, by <hi>Euſebius, Hierom, Damaſus,</hi> and many others. Or if with <hi>Petavius, Ricciolus,</hi> and ſome others, we aſſign the Martyrdom of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Ann.</hi> LXVII. two years later, the computation will ſtill run more ſmooth and eaſie, and there will be time enough to be allowed for the odd moneths and days aſſigned by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts, and to make the years of their Pontificat compleat and full. Nor can I think of any way, conſidering the great intricacy and perplexity of the thing, that can bid fairer for an eaſie ſolution of this matter. For granting <hi>Clemens</hi> to have been ordained by <hi>S.

The conjecture that has obtained with ſome of moſt note and learning is, that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> while the Temple and the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> miniſtration were yet ſtanding. Which they collect, I ſuppoſe, from a

But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever impartially conſiders the place, will find no neceſſary foundation for ſuch an inference, and that S. <hi>Clemens</hi> his deſign was onely to illuſtrate his Argument, and to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of obſerving thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Stations and Miniſtries which God has appointed us, by alluding to the Ordinances of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Inſtitution. To me it ſeems moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have been written a little after the Perſecution under <hi>Domitian,</hi> and probably not long before <hi>Clemens</hi> his exile. For excuſing the no ſooner anſwering the Letters of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he

It was written upon occaſion of a great Schiſm and Sedition in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> begun by two or three factious perſons againſt the Governours of the Church, who envying either the gifts, or the authority and eſteem of their Guides and Teachers, had attempted to depoſe them, and had drawn the greateſt part of the Church into the Conſpiracy: whom therefore he endeavours by ſoft words and hard Arguments to reduce back to Peace and Unity. His modeſty and humility in it are peculiarly diſcernable, not onely that he wholly writes it in the name of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without ſo much as ever mentioning his own, but in that he treats them with ſuch gentle and mild perſuaſives. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſowreneſs, or an imperious <hi>lording it over Gods heritage</hi> to be ſeen in the whole Epiſtle. Had he known himſelf to be the infallible Judge of Controverſies, to whoſe ſentence the whole Chriſtian World was bound to ſtand, inveſted with a ſupreme unaccountable Power, from which there lay no Appeal, we might have expected to have heard him argue at another rate. But theſe were the Encroachments and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of later Ages, when a ſpirit of Covetouſneſs and ſecular ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſtifled the modeſty and ſimplicity of thoſe firſt and beſt Ages of Religion.

The <hi>Rechabites</hi> were an ancient Inſtitution, founded by <hi>Jonadab the ſon of Rechab,</hi> who flouriſhed in the reign of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and obliged his poſterity to theſe following Rules, to drink no Wine, ſowe no Fields,
<note place="margin">Jer. 35.2, 3, &amp;c.</note> plant no Vineyards, build no Houſes, but to dwell onely in Tents and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. All which precepts (the laſt onely excepted, which Wars and Foreign Invaſions would not ſuffer them to obſerve) they kept with the moſt religious reverence, and are therefore highly commended by God for their exact conformity to the Laws of their Inſtitution, and brought in to upbraid the degeneracy of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Commands he had laid upon them.

THE Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> daily expecting his arrival, were come out to meet and entertain him, and accordingly received him with an equal reſentment of joy and ſorrow. Glad they were of the preſence and company of ſo great and good a man, but quickly found their joy allayed with the remembrance, how ſoon, and by how ſevere a death he was to be taken from them: and when ſome of them did but intimate,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60969:88"/>that poſſibly the People might be taken off from deſiring his death, he expreſſed a pious indignation, intreating them to caſt no rubs in his way, nor do any thing that might hinder him, now he was haſtening to his Crown. Being conducted to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was preſented to the <hi>Praefect</hi> of the City, and as 'tis probable, the Emperours Letters concerning him were delivered. In the mean time while things were preparing for his Martyrdom, he and the Brethren that reſorted to him improved their time to pious purpoſes; he prayed with them, and for them, heartily recommended the ſtate of the Church to the care and protection of our bleſſed Saviour, and earneſtly ſolicited Heaven, that it would ſtop the Perſecution that was begun, and bleſs Chriſtians with a true love and charity towards one another.

Accordingly on the XIII. of the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> that is, <hi>December</hi> XX. he was brought out into the <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi> and according to his own fervent deſire, that he might have no other grave but the bellies of wild Beaſts, the Lions were let looſe upon him, whoſe roaring alarm he entertained with no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, then that now as Gods own Corn he ſhould be ground between the teeth of theſe wild Beaſts, and become White Bread for his heavenly Maſter. The Lions were not long doing their work, but quickly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched their Meal, and left nothing but what they could not well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, a few hard and ſolid bones.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60969:92"/>and reclaimed by that Apoſtle. But ſeeing <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who relates the Story, ſets down neither the name of the Biſhop, nor the City, though he

Though it cannot be denied but that <hi>Smyrna</hi> was near to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as S. <hi>Clemens</hi> ſays that City alſo was, and that S. <hi>John</hi> ſeems to have had a more then ordinary regard to that Church, it being next <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the firſt of thoſe ſeven famous <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, to whom he directed his Epiſtles, and S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> at this time Biſhop of it: for that he was that <hi>Angel of the Church of Smyrna,</hi> to whom that Apocalyptical Epiſtle was ſent, is not onely highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but by a

I muſt confeſs that the character and circumſtances aſcribed by S. <hi>John</hi> to the Angel of that Church ſeem very exactly to agree with <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and with no other Biſhop of that Church (about thoſe times eſpecially) that we read of in the Hiſtory of the Church. And whoever compares the account of S. <hi>Polycarps</hi> Martyrdom, with the notices and intimations which the <hi>Apocalypſt</hi> there gives of that perſons ſufferings and death, will find the prophecy and the event ſuit together. That which may ſeem to make moſt againſt it, is, the long time of his preſidency over that See: ſeeing by this account he muſt ſit at leaſt LXXIV years Biſhop of that Church, from the latter end of <hi>Domitians</hi> reign (when the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was written) to the Perſecution under M. <hi>Aurelius,</hi> when he ſuffered. To which no other ſolution needs be given, then that his great, nay extreme Age at the time of his death renders it not at all improbable; eſpecially when we find ſeveral Ages after, that <hi>Remigius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> ſate LXXIV years Biſhop of that place.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. IT was not many years after S. <hi>Johns</hi> death, when the Perſecution under <hi>Trajan</hi> began to be reinforced, wherein the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts had a very large ſhare. <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> CVII. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was condemned by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſentenced to be tranſported to <hi>Rome</hi> in order to his execution. In his voyage thither he put in at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to ſalute and converſe with <hi>Polycarp,</hi> theſe holy men mutually comforting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging each other, and conferring together about the affairs of the Church. From <hi>Smyrna Ignatius</hi> and his company ſailed to <hi>Troas,</hi> whence he ſent back an Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> wherein he endeavours to fortifie them againſt the errours of the Times which had crept in amongſt them, eſpecially againſt thoſe who undermined our Lords hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and denied his coming in the Fleſh, affirming him to have ſuffered onely in an imaginary and phantaſtic body. An opinion, (which as it deſerved) he ſeverely cenſures, and ſtrongly refutes. He further preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to a due obſervance and regard of their Biſhop, and thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guides and Miniſters which under him were ſet over them; and that they would diſpatch a meſſenger on purpoſe to the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> to congratulate that peace and tranquillity which then began to be reſtored to them. Beſides this he wrote particularly to S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whom he knew to be a man of an Apoſtolic temper, a perſon of ſingular faithfulneſs and integrity, recommending to him the care and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of his diſconſolate Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> In the Epiſtle it ſelf, as extant at this day, there are many ſhort and uſeful rules and precepts of life, eſpecially ſuch as concern the Paſtoral and Epiſcopal Office.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60969:92"/>And here again he renews his requeſt concerning <hi>Antioch,</hi> that a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might be ſent from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to that Church, and that S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> would write to other Churches to do the like; a thing which he would have done himſelf, had not his haſty departure from <hi>Troas</hi> prevented him. And more then this we find not concerning <hi>Polycarp</hi> for many years after, till ſome unhappy differences in the Church brought him upon the public Stage.</p>

Three days before his apprehenſion falling at night as he was at prayer into a trance, he dreamt that his Pillow was on fire, and burned to aſhes; which when he awakened, he told his friends was a prophetic preſage, that he ſhould be burnt alive for the cauſe of Chriſt. In the mean time he was every where narrowly ſought for, upon notice whereof his friends perſwaded him to retire into another Village, whither he was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come but his enemies were at hand, who ſeizing upon a couple of youths (one of whom by ſtripes they forced to a confeſſion,) were by them conducted to his lodging. Entering the houſe at Evening, they perceived him to be in bed in an upper Room; and though upon notice before hand of their coming he might eaſily have ſaved himſelf by ſlipping into another houſe, yet he refuſed, ſaying, <hi>The will of the Lord be done.</hi> Underſtanding his Perſecutors were there, he came down and ſaluted them with a very chearful and gentle countenance; in ſo much that they who had not hitherto known him, wondered to behold ſo venerable a perſon, of ſo great age, and ſo grave and compoſed a preſence, and what needed all this ſtir to hunt and take this poor old man. He nothing concerned, ordered a Table to be ſpread, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be ſet upon it, inviting them to partake of them, and onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting for himſelf, that in the mean while he might have one hour for Prayer.

Inſomuch that thoſe who were preſent, pitied and grieved at the ſight of it, while they themſelves were endued with ſo invincible a reſolution, that none of them gave one ſigh or groan: the holy Martyrs of Chriſt letting us ſee, that at that time when they were thus tormented, they were ſtrangers to their own bodies; or rather that our Lord ſtood by them to aſſiſt and comfort them. Animated by the grace of Chriſt, they deſpiſed the torments of men, by one ſhort hour delivering themſelves from eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: the fire which their Tormenters put to them ſeemed cool and little, while they had it in their eye, to avoid the everlaſting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguiſhable flames of another World; their thoughts being fixed upon thoſe rewards which are prepared for them that endure to the end, ſuch as <hi>neither ear hath heard, nor eye hath ſeen, nor hath it entered into the heart of man;</hi> but which were ſhewn to them by our Lord, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now no longer Mortals, but entering upon the ſtate of Angels. In like manner thoſe who were condemned to be devoured by wild Beaſts, for a long time endured the moſt grievous tortures; ſhells of Fiſhes were ſtrewed under their naked bodies, and they forced to lie upon ſharp pointed ſtakes driven into the ground, and ſeveral ſuch like Engines of torture deviſed for them, that (if poſſible) by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of their torments, the enemy might drive them to renounce the Faith of Chriſt: Various were the methods of puniſhments which the Devil did invent, though bleſſed be God, there were not many, whom they were able to prevail upon.—</q> And at the end of the Epiſtle they particularly remark concerning <hi>Polycarp,</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. <hi>THESE things, Brethren, I write to you concerning righteouſneſs, not of my own humour, but becauſe your ſelves did provoke me to it. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor any other ſuch as I am, can attain to the wiſdom of bleſſed and glorious S.</hi> Paul, <hi>who being among you, and converſing perſonally with thoſe who were then alive, firmly and accurately taught the word of truth; and when abſent, wrote Epiſtles to you, by which, if you look into them, ye may be built in the Faith, delivered unto you, which is the Mother of us all, being followed by Hope, and led on by Love, both towards God, and Chriſt, and to our neighbour. For whoever is inwardly repleniſhed with theſe things, has fulfilled the law of righteouſneſs; and he that is furniſhed with love, ſtands at a diſtance from all ſin.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.7.</note> But</hi> the love of Money <hi>is the beginning</hi> of all evil. <hi>Knowing therefore</hi> that we brought nothing into the World, and that we ſhall carry nothing out, <hi>let us arm our ſelves with the armour of righteouſneſs, and in the firſt place be inſtructed our ſelves to walk in the commands of the Lord, and next teach your Wives to live in the Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, in love, and chaſtity, that they embrace their own husbands with all integrity, and others alſo with all temperance and continency, and that they educate and diſcipline their children in the fear of God. The Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, that they be ſober and modeſt concerning the Faith of the Lord, that they inceſſantly intercede for all, and keep themſelves from all ſlandring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, falſe witneſs, covetouſneſs, and every evil work: as knowing that they are the</hi> Altars <hi>of God, and that he accurately ſurveys the ſacrifice, and that nothing can be concealed from him, neither of our reaſonings, nor thoughts, nor the ſecrets of the heart. Accordingly knowing that God is not mocked, we ought to walk worthy of his command, and of his glory.</hi>

                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV. LIKEWISE let the Deacons be unblamable before his righteous preſence, as the Miniſters of God in Chriſt, and not of men; not accuſers, not double-tongued, not covetous, but temperate in all things, compaſſionate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who became the</hi> Deacon <hi>or ſervant of all: of whom, if we be careful to pleaſe him in this World, we ſhall receive the reward of the other life according as he has promiſed to raiſe us from the dead: and if we walk worthy of him,</hi> we believe that we ſhall alſo reign with him. <hi>Let the Young men alſo be unblamable in all things, ſtudying in the firſt place to be chaſte, and to reſtrain themſelves from all that is evil. For it is a good thing to get above the luſts of the World, ſeeing every Luſt wars againſt the Spirit; and that</hi> neither Fornicators,

                  <p n="5">V. <hi>WHEREFORE it's neceſſary that ye abſtain from all theſe things, being ſubject to the Presbyters and Deacons, as to God and Chriſt: that the Virgins alſo walk with a chaſt and undefiled conſcience.

If therefore we ſtand in need to pray the Lord that he would forgive us, we our ſelves ought alſo to forgive. For we are before the eyes of him, who is Lord and God,

For</hi> every one, that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; <hi>and he who doth not acknowledge the martyrdom of the Croſs, is of the Devil, and whoever ſhall pervert the Oracles of the Lord to his private luſts, and ſhall ſay, that there is neither reſurrection nor judgment to come, that man is</hi> the firſt-born of Satan. <hi>Leaving therefore the vanity of many, and their falſe doctrines, let us return to that doctrine, that from the beginning was delivered to us: let us be watchful in Prayers, perſevering in Faſting, and Supplications, beſeeching the All-ſeeing God that he would not lead us into temptation;
<note place="margin">Matt. 26.41.</note> as the Lord has ſaid,</hi> the Spirit indeed is willing but the Fleſh is weak. <hi>Let us unweariedly and conſtantly adhere to Jeſus Chriſt, who is our hope and the pledge of our righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22, 24.</note> who bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree, who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, <hi>but endured all things for our ſakes, that we might live through him. Let us then imitate his patience, and if we ſuffer for his Name, we glorifie him; for ſuch a pattern he ſet us in himſelf, and this we have believed and entertained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>I exhort you therefore all, that ye be obedient to the word of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that you exerciſe all manner of patience, as you have ſeen it ſet forth before your eyes, not onely in the bleſſed</hi> Ignatius, <hi>and</hi> Zoſimus, <hi>and</hi> Rufus, <hi>but in others alſo among you, and in</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf, and the reſt of the Apoſtles; being aſſured that all theſe have not run in vain, but in faith and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are arrived at the place, due and promiſed to them by the Lord, of whoſe ſufferings they were made partakers. For they loved not this preſent world, but him who both died, and was raiſed up again by God for us. Stand faſt therefore in theſe things, and follow the example of the Lord, being firm and immutable in the faith, lovers of the brethren, and kindly affectionate one towards another, united in the truth, carrying your ſelves meekly to each other, deſpiſing no man. When it is in your power to do good, defer it not, for</hi> Alms delivereth from death. Be all of you ſubject one to another, having your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles; <hi>that both you your ſelves may receive praiſe by your good works, and that God be not blaſphemed through you. For wo unto him, by whom the Name of the Lord is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Wherefore teach all men ſobriety, and be your ſelves converſant in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>I am exceedingly troubled for</hi> Valens, <hi>who was ſometimes ordained a</hi> Presbyter <hi>among you, that he ſo little underſtands the place wherein he was ſet. I therefore warn you, that you abſtain from covetouſneſs, and that ye be chaſt and true. Keep your ſelves from every evil work. But he that in theſe things cannot govern himſelf, how ſhall he preach it to another? If a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain not from covetouſneſs, he will be defiled with Idolatry, and ſhall be judged among the Heathen.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2.</note> Who is ignorant of the judgment of the Lord?</hi> Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the World? <hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>teaches.

For of you he boaſts in all thoſe Churches, which onely knew God at that time, whom as yet we had not known. I am therefore, Brethren, greatly troubled for him, and for his Wife, the Lord give them true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60969:99"/>Be ye alſo ſober as to this matter, and account not ſuch as enemies, but reſtore them as weak and erring members, that the whole body of you may be ſaved; for in ſo doing, ye build up your ſelves.</hi>

                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>YE wrote unto me, both ye and</hi> Ignatius, <hi>that if any one go into</hi> Syria, <hi>he might carry your Letters along with him: which I will do ſo ſoon as I ſhall have a convenient opportunity, either my ſelf, or by ſome other, whom I will ſend upon your errand.

This the grave perſon refutes at large, and at laſt comes to ſhew him, who were the moſt likely perſons to ſet him in the right way. He tells him, that there were long before his reputed Philoſophers, certain bleſſed and holy men, lovers of God, and divinely inſpired, called <hi>Prophets,</hi> who foretold things which have ſince come to paſs; who alone underſtood the truth, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly declared it to the World, whoſe Books yet extant would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a man in what moſt became a Philoſopher to know; the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of whoſe predictions did ſufficiently atteſt their faithfulneſs and integrity, and the mighty miracles which they wrought, ſet the truth of what they ſaid beyond all exception; that they magnified God the great Creator of the World, and publiſhed his Son Chriſt to the World: Concluding his diſcourſe with this advice, <hi>But as for thy ſelf, above all things pray that the Gates of Light may ſet open to thee; for theſe are not things diſcerned and underſtood by all, unleſs God and Chriſt grant to a man the knowledge of them.</hi> Which diſcourſe being ended, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately departed from him.</p>

Whereupon he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the proſecution of his Wife, and fell upon one <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> by whom ſhe had been converted to the Chriſtian Faith, whom he procured to be caſt into priſon, and there a long time tortured meerly upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelf a Chriſtian.

Above all his Maſters he had a particular reverence and regard to him, communicated to him all his public and private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſhewed him reſpect before all the great Officers of the Empire, and after his death required of the Senate that he might be honoured with a public Statue. He had been <hi>Conſul</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and again in the ſecond of the preſent Emperours, and was now <hi>Praefect</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> before whom theſe good men being brought, he perſuaded <hi>Juſtin</hi> to obey the gods, and comply with the Emperours Edicts. The <hi>Martyr</hi> told him, that no man could be juſtly found fault with, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that obeyed the commands of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Then the Governour enquired in what kind of learning and diſcipline he had been brought up: he told him, that he had endeavoured to underſtand all kinds of Diſcipline, and tried all methods of Learning, but had finally taken up his reſt in the Chriſtian Diſcipline, how little ſoever it was eſteemed by thoſe who were led by errour and falſe opinions. Wretch that thou art (ſaid the Governour) art thou then taken with that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline? I am, replied the <hi>Martyr,</hi> for with right doctrine do I follow the Chriſtians. And when asked what that Doctrine was; he anſwered, the right Doctrine which we Chriſtians piouſly profeſs, is this, We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the one onely God to be the Creator of all things viſible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and confeſs our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God, foretold by the Prophets of old, and who ſhall hereafter come to be the Judge of Mankind, a Saviour, Preacher, and Maſter to all thoſe, who are duly inſtructed by him: that as for himſelf, he thought himſelf too mean to be able to ſay any thing becoming his infinite deity; that this was the buſineſs of the Prophets, who had many Ages before foretold the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Son of God into the World.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. THE <hi>Praefect</hi> next enquired where the Chriſtians were wont to aſſemble, and being told, that the God of the Chriſtians was not confined to a particular place, he asked in what place <hi>Juſtin</hi> was wont to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60969:110"/>inſtruct his Diſciples, who gave him an account of the place where he dwelt, and told him that there he preached the Chriſtian Doctrine to all that reſorted to him. Then having ſeverally examined his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he again addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Juſtin</hi> in this manner. Hear thou that art noted for thy eloquence, and thinkeſt thou art in the truth; if I cauſe thee to be ſcourged from head to foot, thinkeſt thou thou ſhalt go to Heaven? He anſwered, that although he ſhould ſuffer what the other had threatned, yet he hoped he ſhould enjoy the portion of all true Chriſtians, well knowing that the divine grace and favour was laid up for all ſuch, and ſhould be as long as the World endured. And when again asked, whether he thought he ſhould go to Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reward; he replied, that he did not think it onely, but knew, and was ſo certain of it, that there was no cauſe to doubt it. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſeeing it was to no purpoſe to argue, came cloſer to the matter in hand, and bad them go together, and unanimouſly ſacrifice to the gods. No man (replied the <hi>Martyr</hi>) that is in his right mind, will deſert true Religion to fall into errour and impiety. And when threatned that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they complied, they ſhould be tormented without mercy; There is nothing (ſaid <hi>Juſtin</hi>) which we more earneſtly deſire, then to endure torments for the ſake of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and be ſaved. For this is that which will promote our happineſs, and procure us confidence before that dreadful Tribunal of our Lord and Saviour, before which by the divine appointment, the whole World muſt appear. To which the reſt aſſented, adding, Diſpatch quickly what thou haſt a mind to, for we are Chriſtians, and cannot ſacrifice to Idols. Whereupon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour pronounced this ſentence; <hi>They who refuſe to do ſacrifice to the gods, and to obey the Imperial Edict, let them be firſt ſcourged, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed according to the Laws.</hi> The holy Martyrs rejoiced and bleſſed God for the ſentence paſſed upon them, and being led back to priſon, were accordingly whipped, and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.

                  <p n="17">XVII. THUS have we traced the <hi>Martyr</hi> through the ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life, and brought him to his laſt fatal period. And now let us view him a little nearer. He was a man of a pious mind, and a very vertuous life; tenderly ſenſible of the honour of God, and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Religion. He was not elated, nor valued himſelf upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his great abilities, but upon every occaſion intirely reſolved the glory of all into the divine grace and goodneſs. He had a true love to all men, and a mighty concern for the good of ſouls, whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he continually prayed for and promoted, yea, that of their fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Enemies. From none did he and his Religion receive more bitter affronts and oppoſitions then from the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he tells

In the purſuit of this noble and generous deſign he feared no dangers, but delivered himſelf with the greateſt freedom and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; he acquaints the

The miſtake is not worth confuting and ſcarce deſerves mentioning, that makes him the ſame with that <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Luke</hi> dedicates his Evangelical Writings, ſo great the diſtance of time (if there were nothing more) between them. Whether he was born at <hi>Antioch</hi> is uncertain: but where-ever he was born, his Parents were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by whom he was brought up in the common Rites of that Religion that then governed the World. They gave him all the accompliſhments of a learned and liberal Education, and vaſt improvements he made in the progreſs of his Studies, ſo that he was throughly verſed in the Writings of all the great Maſters of Learning and Philoſophy in the Heathen World: which being ſet off with a quick and a pleaſant wit (as appears from his Diſputes againſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) rendred him a man of no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable note and account among them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. WHEN or by what means converted to Chriſtianity, is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble particularly to determine: thus much onely may be gathered from the Diſcourſes which he left behind him. Being a man of an inquiſitive temper, and doubtleſs of a very honeſt mind, he gave up himſelf to a more free and impartial ſearch into the nature and ſtate of things. He found that the account of things which that Religion gave, wherein he was then engaged, was altogether unſatisfactory, that the ſtories of their gods were abſurd and frivolous, and ſome of them prophane and impious, that their Rites of Worſhip were trifling and ridiculous; he conſidered the ſeveral parts of the Creation, and that excellent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that governed the World, wherein he eaſily diſcerned the plain notices of a wiſe and omnipotent Being, and that God had purpoſely diſpoſed things thus, that his <hi>Grandeur</hi> and Majeſty might appear to all. Accordingly he directs his friend to this method of conviction, as that which doubtleſs he had found moſt ſucceſsful and ſatisfactory to himſelf. He bids

And indeed ſo ſtrangely was he raviſhed with the conſideration of this Argument, that he profeſſes

Indeed there is ſcarce any Principle of the Chriſtian Faith, that generally met with more oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the wiſe and the learned, and which was more difficultly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their Creed. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Philoſophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> while he told them of a judgment to come, they made no ſcruple to give it entertainment, it being a principle evident by natural light, till he diſcourſed of a future Reſurrection; and this they rejected with contempt and ſcorn,

AFTER this he put him in mind how much the Empire had proſpered ſince the riſe of Chriſtianity, and that none but the worſt of his Predeceſſors had entertained an implacable ſpight againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <q>This new Sect of Philoſophy (ſays he) which we profeſs, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore flouriſhed among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (by which probably he means the <hi>Jews.</hi>) Afterwards under the reign of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> your Predeceſſor, it ſpread it ſelf over the Provinces of your Empire, commencing with a happy <hi>omen</hi> to it: ſince which time the Majeſty and Greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire hath mightily increaſed, whereof you are the wiſhed-for Heir and Succeſſor, and together with your Son ſhall ſo continue, eſpecially while you protect that Religion, which begun with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and grew up together with the Empire, and for which your Predeceſſors had together with other Rites of Worſhip, ſome kind of reverence and regard. And that our Religion, which was bred up with the proſperity of the Empire, was born for public good, there is this great Argument to convince you, that ſince the reign of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> there has no conſiderable miſchief happened; but on the contrary all things according to every ones deſire have fallen out glorious and ſucceſsful. None but <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> inſtigated by cruel and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men, have attempted to reproach and calumniate our Religion; whence ſprang the common ſlanders concerning us, the injudicious Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar greedily entertaining ſuch reports without any ſtrict examination.

As indeed they do, eſpecially as to the moral and practic part of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. They held that nothing was good but what was juſt and pious, nothing evil but what was vicious and diſhoneſt; that a bad man could never be happy, nor a good man miſerable, who was always free, generous, and dear to Heaven; that the deity was perpetually concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for humane affairs, and that there was a wiſe and powerful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that particularly ſuperintended the happineſs of mankind, and was ready to aſſiſt men in all lawful and vertuous undertakings; that therefore this God was above all things to be admired, adored, and worſhipped, prayed to, acknowledged, obeyed, praiſed, and that it is the moſt comely and reaſonable thing in the World, that we ſhould uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſubmit to his will, and <gap reason="foreign">

And whoever runs over the Writings of <hi>Seneca, Antoninus, Epictetus, Arrian,</hi> &amp;c. will find theſe, and a great many more claiming a very near kindred with the main rules of life preſcribed in the Chriſtian Faith. And what wonder if <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenus</hi> was in love with ſuch generous and manly principles, which he liked ſo well, that as he always retained the title of the <hi>Stoic Philoſopher,</hi> ſo for the main he owned the profeſſion of that Sect, even after his being admitted to eminent Offices and Imployments in the Chriſtian Church.</p>

Or ſuppoſe with others that this <hi>Tertylian</hi> was one of <hi>Papinians</hi> Scholars in the reign of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> he muſt by this account be at leaſt thirty years after the others Converſion to Chriſtianity. The original of the Errour doubtleſs aroſe from the nearneſs and ſimilitude of the names, and the character of his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60969:136"/>skill in the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws given by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which indeed is evident from his Works, and eſpecially his <hi>Apology</hi> for the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. WHAT was his particular courſe of life before he came over to the Chriſtian Religion, is uncertain. They that conceive him to have been an Advocate, and publicly to have pleaded Cauſes, becauſe after his Converſion he

That he was married is evident, though whether before or after his embracing the Chriſtian Faith, I cannot poſitively determine, probably before. However according to the ſeverity of his principles, he lived with his wife a great partof his life in a ſtate of Continency, converſing with her as his ſiſter, exhorting her to perpetual coelibacy, and the utmoſt ſtrictneſſes of a ſingle life, as appears by his two Books written to her upon that Subject.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. HIS converſion to Chriſtianity we may conceive to have hapned not long after the beginning of <hi>Severus</hi> his reign, and a little before the concluſion of the ſecond Century. Being a man of an inquiſitive and ſagacious mind, he had obſerved the powerful and triumphant efficacy of the Chriſtian Faith over the minds and lives of men, its great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the admirable conſent and truth of the Predictions recorded in the Books of the Chriſtians, the frequent Teſtimonies which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then deities themſelves gave to its truth and divinity, the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their <hi>Daemons</hi> when forced to abandon the perſons they had poſſeſſed, at the command of a Chriſtian, all which he ſhews

                     </note> at large (at leaſt as we may probably gueſs) to have been the main inducements of his Converſion. In the very entrance of the following <hi>Seculum, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> being gone to make War upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the Magiſtrates at <hi>Rome,</hi> and proportionably the Governours of Provinces, began to bear hard upon the Chriſtians, beholding them as infamous perſons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Traitors to the Empire. Among whom the moſt principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I doubt not, was <hi>Plautianus,</hi> a man in great favour with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, whoſe daughter was married to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperours eldeſt Son, and whom <hi>Severus</hi> at his going into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> had made <hi>Praefect</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> of him we read

                     <hi>Severus</hi> at his return was forced to apologize for himſelf, that he had no hand in it. And indeed <hi>Severus</hi> in the firſt part of his reign (was as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms

Nor did his kindneſs terminate here, for when he knew that ſeveral both men and Women of the <hi>Senatorian</hi> Order were Chriſtians, he was ſo far from perſecuting them upon that account, that he gave them an honourable teſtimony, and reſtrained the people, when they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againſt the Chriſtians. This I ſuppoſe to have been done at his return from the <hi>Parthian</hi> Expedition, when he found both Governours and People engaged in ſo hot and ſevere a Perſecution of the Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. THE barbarous and cruel uſage which the Chriſtians generally met with, engaged <hi>Tertullian</hi> to vindicate and plead their cauſe both againſt the malice and cruelty of their enemies. For which purpoſe he publiſhed and ſent abroad his <hi>Apology,</hi> dedicating it to the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and eſpecially the Senate at <hi>Rome</hi> (for that he went to <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, and perſonally preſented it to the <hi>Senate,</hi> I confeſs, I ſee no convincing evidence) wherein with incomparable learning and eloquence, with all poſſible evidence and ſtrength of reaſon he pleads their Cauſe, complains of the iniquity and injuſtice of their enemies, and the methods of their proceedings, particularly demonſtrates the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and falſhood of thoſe crimes that were commonly charged upon the Chriſtians, arguing their meekneſs and innocency, their temperance and ſobriety, their piety to God, and obedience to their Prince, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of their principles, and the holineſs of their lives, beyond all juſt exception. An Apology which undoubtedly contributed towards the cooling and qualifying of the preſent Calentures, eſpecially at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> his return. And indeed it appears not by the whole ſeries of that Diſcourſe, that the Emperour had given any particular countenance to thoſe ſeverities; nay on the contrary, he expreſly ſtiles

To vindicate himſelf he writes this Diſcourſe, wherein he puts forth the keeneſs of a Sarcaſtic Wit, and ſpreads all the ſails of his <hi>African</hi> eloquence, retorts the caſe upon his accuſers, ſhews the antiquity, ſimplicity, eaſineſs, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of this habit, and ſmartly upbraids that luxury and prodigality that had over-run all orders and ranks of men. And that this was done about this time, and not at his firſt taking upon him the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, is judiciouſly obſerved and urged by <hi>Baronius</hi>

What was this but needleſly to betray their liberty, and to ſacrifice the general quiet and peace of Chriſtians to one mans private humour? to give the common Enemy too juſt a provocation to fall upon them? where did the Laws of their Religion forbid ſuch an innocent compliance, nay rather not onely give leave, but command us prudently to decline a danger, by withdrawing from it? what was this but a ſturdy and an affected ſingularity, as if he had been the onely Chriſtian? <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whoſe mighty zeal engaged him to be a Patron to whatever had but the ſhadow of ſtrictneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, preſently ſet himſelf to defend the fact, and wrote his Book <hi>De Corona Militis,</hi> wherein he cries up the Act as an heroic piece of Zeal and Chriſtian Magnanimity, not onely warrantable, but honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not onely lawful, but juſt and neceſſary, fortifying his aſſertion with ſeveral arguments, and endeavouring to diſable the moſt ſpecious objections that were made againſt it.

Proſelytes he wanted not, that came over to his Party. At firſt onely ſome few of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the <hi>Phrygians</hi> (whence his Sect derived the title of <hi>Cataphryges</hi>) were drawn into the ſnare, whom he inſtructed in the Arts of Evil ſpeaking, teaching them to reproach the whole Chriſtian Church for refuſing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and honor his Pſeudo-prophetic Spirit, the ſame Spirit on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pronouncing them bleſſed that joyned themſelves to this new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and ſwelling them with the mighty hopes and promiſes of what ſhould happen to them, ſometimes alſo gently reproving and condemning them. Among the reſt of his Diſciples two women were eſpecially remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, <hi>Priſca,</hi> and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> whom having firſt corrupted, he imparted his <hi>Daemon</hi> to them, whereby they were preſently enabled to utter the moſt frantic, incoherent and extravagant Diſcourſes. The truth is he ſeemed to lay his Scene with all imaginable craft and ſubtlety; in the great and foundation-principles of Religion he agreed with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, embraced entirely the holy Scriptures, and pretended that he muſt receive the gifts of Divine Grace extrarordinarily conferred upon him, which he gave out were more immediately the Holy Ghoſt: he made a ſingular ſhew of ſome uncommon rigours and ſeverities in Religion, gave Laws for more ſtrict and ſolemn Faſts, and more frequently to be obſerved, then were among the Orthodox, taught Divorces to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and forbad all ſecond marriages, called <hi>Pepuza</hi> and <hi>Tymium,</hi> two little Towns of <hi>Phrygia, Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſo he might the more plauſibly invite ſimple and unwary Proſelytes to flock thither. And becauſe he knew no ſurer way to oblige ſuch perſons as would be ſerviceable to him, then by Propoſals of gain and advantage, he uſed all methods of extorting money from his deluded followers, eſpecially under the notion of Gifts and Offerings, for which purpoſe he appointed Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to receive the Oblations that were brought in, with which he maintained under-Officers, and paid Salaries to thoſe that propagated his Doctrines up and down the World.

This, a man of a moroſe and unyielding diſpoſition, and who could brook no moderation that ſeemed to intrench upon the Diſcipline and Practice of Religion, could not bear, and therefore making light of the judgment and cenſures of that Church, flew off, and joined himſelf to <hi>Montanus</hi> his Party, whoſe pretended auſterities ſeemed of all others moſt agreeable to his humour and <hi>genius,</hi> and moſt exactly to conſpire with the courſe and method of his life. But as it cannot be doubted that he looked no further then to the appearances and pretenſions of that Sect (not ſeeing the corrupt Springs by which the Engine was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged within) ſo it is moſt reaſonable and charitable to conceive, that he never underſtood their principles in the utmoſt latitude and extent of them. If he ſeems ſometimes to acknowledge <hi>Montanus</hi> to be the <hi>Paraclete</hi> that was to come into the World, probably he meant not ſomething diſtinct from the Holy Spirit beſtowed upon the Apoſtles, but a mighty power and extraordinary aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt ſhed upon <hi>Montanus,</hi> whom God had ſent into the World, more fully and perfectly to explain the Doctrines of the Goſpel, and to urge the rules and inſtitutions of the Chriſtian life, which our Lord had delivered when he was upon earth, but did not with the greateſt accuracy the things were capable of, the minds of men not being then duly qualified to receive them. That for this end he thought <hi>Montanus</hi> inveſted with miraculous powers and a ſpirit of Propheſie (a thing not unuſual even in thoſe times) and might believe his two Propheteſſes to be acted with the ſame ſpirit. All which might conſiſt with an honeſt mind, impoſed upon by crafty and plauſible pretences. And plain it is that for ſome conſiderable time <hi>Montanus</hi> maintained the reputation of great piety, zeal, ſanctity, and extraordinary gifts, before he was diſcovered to the World. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in all likelihood had his accounts concerning him, not from himſelf, but from <hi>Proclus,</hi> or ſome others of the Party, who might eaſily delude him, eſpecially in matters of fact, with falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations. However nothing can be more evident, then that he

Againſt theſe <hi>Pſychici</hi> he preſently publiſhed a Tract <hi>De Jejuniis,</hi> wherein he defends the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faſts, their abſtinence from Fleſh, and feeding onely upon dried meats, their Stationary days, and the keeping them till the very evening, while the Orthodox broke up theirs about three of the Clock in the afternoon; in all which reſpects he makes many tart and ſevere reflections upon them. Indeed the devotions of thoſe times were brisk and fervent, their uſages ſtrict and punctual, their Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic Diſcipline generally very rigid and extreme, ſeldom admitting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that had lapſed after Baptiſm to Penance and the Communion of the Church. But this was looked upon by moderate and ſober men as making the gate too ſtrait, and that which could not but diſcourage Coverts from entering in.

Nor is it likely he would balk any Story that tended to <hi>Origen</hi>'s diſgrace, who had himſelf ſo bitter a zeal and ſpleen againſt him. I might further argue the improbability of this Story from hence, that this being a long time after his famous emaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of himſelf, which by this time was known all abroad, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Heathens ſhould make the proſtituting himſelf in committing adultery one part of his choice, which his ſelf-contracted impotency and <hi>Eunuchiſm</hi> had long ſince made impoſſible to him.

While he continued here (which was not long) he returned an anſwer to the Letter which he had lately received from <hi>Julius Africanus</hi> concerning the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which <hi>Africanus</hi> by ſhort but very forcible arguments maintained to be a fictitious and ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious relation. <hi>Origen</hi> undertakes the caſe, and juſtifies the Story to be ſincere and genuine, but by arguments, which rather manifeſt the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his parts, then the goodneſs of his cauſe, and clearly ſhew how much men of the greateſt learning and abilities are put to it, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to uphold a weak ſide, and which has no truth of its own to ſupport it ſelf. It happened about this time that <hi>Beryllus</hi>

                        <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 33.</note> Biſhop of <hi>Boſtra</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> fell into abſurd and dangerous errours, aſſerting, that our Lord before his incarnation had no proper ſubſiſtence, no perſonal Deity, but onely a derivative divinity from his Father. The Biſhops of thoſe parts met about it, but could not reclaim the man, whereupon <hi>Origen</hi>'s aſſiſtance was requeſted, who went thither, and treated with him both in private conferences and in public Synods. His greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was to know what the man meant, which when he had once found out, he plied him ſo hard with cogent reaſonings and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, that he was forced to let go his hold, recant his errours, and return back into the way of truth. Which done, <hi>Origen</hi> took his leave, and came back for <hi>Paleſtin.</hi> And <hi>Beryllus</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Hieron. de Script. in Beryll.</note>, as became a true Convert, in ſeveral Letters gave thanks to <hi>Origen</hi> for his kind pains in his convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, kiſſing the hand that brought him back.</p>

To this <hi>Origen</hi> returns a full and ſolid anſwer in eight Books, wherein as he had the better cauſe, ſo he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it with that ſtrength of Reaſon, clearneſs of Argument, and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive evidence of truth, that were there nothing elſe to teſtifie the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of this great man, this Book alone were enough to do it. It was written probably about the beginning of the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, with whom <hi>Origen</hi> ſeems to have had ſome acquaintance, who
<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Id. ibid. p.</hi> 233</note> wrote one Letter to him, and another to the Empreſs. From whence, and ſome other little probabilities, <hi>Euſebius</hi> firſt, and after him the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Eccleſiaſtic Writers, have made that Emperour to have been a Chriſtian, and the firſt of the Imperial line that was ſo. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of which miſtake, and the original from whence it ſprung, we have ſhewed elſewhere.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60969:150"/>maintain the truth in his heart. They carried a Book about with them which they affirmed to have been immediately dropt down from Heaven, which whoever received and gave credit to, ſhould receive remiſſion of ſins, though different from that pardon which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> beſtowed upon his followers. But how far <hi>Origen</hi> was concerned againſt this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ſenſleſs generation, is to me unknown.

                     <hi>Perſia</hi> had lately invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and having over-run all <hi>Syria,</hi> had beſieged and taken <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſo great a

He grievouſly oppreſſed the People of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and what treatment the Chriſtians there muſt needs find under ſo mercileſs and inſolent an Enemy (at no time favourable to Chriſtians) is no hard matter to imagine. But it was not long before God broke this yoke from off their necks. For <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> the Emperour raiſing a mighty Army, marched into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and having cleared the Countries as he went along, came into <hi>Syria,</hi> and went directly for <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he totally routed the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, recovered <hi>Antioch</hi> and the conquered Cities, and gained ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places belonging to <hi>Sapor,</hi> whom he forced to retire back into his own Countrey: of all which he gives an account in a

THE Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> being thus reſtored to its former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, <hi>Babylas</hi> attended his charge with all diligence and fidelity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, feeding, and governing his Flock, preparing both young and old to undergo the hardeſt things, which their Religion might expoſe them to, as if he had particularly foreſeen that black and diſmal Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that was ſhortly to overtake them. Having quietly paſſed through the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> (who was ſo far from creating any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the Chriſtians, that he is generally, though groundleſly, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been a Chriſtian himſelf) he fell into the troubleſome and ſtormy times of <hi>Decius,</hi> who was unexpectedly advanced, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forced upon the Empire.

                        <hi>De vit. Greg.

This vaſt increaſe of Chriſtianity, and great declenſion of Paganiſm, awakened <hi>Decius</hi> to look about him: he was vexed to ſee the Religion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire trodden under foot, and the worſhip of the gods every where ſlighted and neglected, oppoſed and undermined by a novel and upſtart Sect of Chriſtians, which daily multiplied into greater numbers. This made him reſolve with all poſſible force to check and control this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sect, and to try by methods of cruelty to weary Chriſtians out of their Profeſſion, and to reduce the People to the Religion of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Whereupon he iſſued out Edicts to the Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, ſtrictly commanding them to proceed with all ſeverity againſt Chriſtians, and to ſpare no manner of torments, unleſs they returned to the obedience and worſhip of the gods.

                  <p n="4">IV. THE Provincial Governours forward enough to run of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon ſuch an errand, made much more haſte, when they were not onely encouraged, but threatned into it by the Imperial Edicts, ſo that the Perſecution was carried on in all parts with a quick and a high hand, concerning the ſeverity whereof we ſhall ſpeak more elſewhere. At preſent it may ſuffice to remarque that it ſwept away many of the moſt eminent Biſhops of the Church, <hi>Fabian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſeveral others.

In this calamitous and tragic Scene, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls the Chriſtians together, inſtructs them in the duties of Mercy and Charity, and from the Precepts and Examples of the holy Scripture ſhews them what a mighty influence they have to oblige God to us; that it was no wonder if their charity extended onely to their own Party, the way to be perfect, and to be Chriſtians indeed, was to od ſomething <hi>more</hi> then <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good,</hi> and in imitation of the divine benignity to <hi>love our enemies,</hi> and according to our Lords advice, to pray for the happineſs of them that perſecute us; that God conſtantly makes his Sun to riſe, and his rain to fall upon the Seeds and Plants, not onely for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his own children, but of all other men; that therefore they ſhould act as became the nobility of their new birth, and imitate the example of ſuch a Father, who profeſſed themſelves to be his children.

Indeed every one was ambitious to engage under the conduct of ſuch a Commander, and in a ſervice wherein they might ſo eminently approve themſelves to God the Father, and Chriſt the Judge of all, and in the mean time to ſo pious and good a Biſhop. And by this large and abundant charity great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage redounded not to themſelves onely, who were <hi>of the houſhold of Faith,</hi> but univerſally to all.

His miraculous inſtruction in the great myſteries of Chriſtianity. His Creed. The mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by him in his return. His expelling</hi> Daemons <hi>out of a</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Temple, and the ſucceſs of it. His welcome entrance into the City, and kind entertainment. His diligent preaching to the people. His erecting a Church for divine worſhip, and its ſignal preſervation. An horrible plague ſtopped by his prayers. The great influence of it upon the minds of the people. His judging in civil cauſes. His drying up a Lake by his prayers, which had been the cauſe of an implacable quarrel between two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And his reſtraining the overflowings of the River</hi> Lyeus. <hi>The ſignal vengeance inflicted upon two</hi> Jews, <hi>counterfeit beggars.

When he was fourteen years of age his Father died, after which he took a greater liberty of enquiring into things, and as his reaſon grew more quick and manly, and was advantaged by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of education, he ſaw more plainly the folly and vanity of that Religion, wherein he had been brought up, which preſently abated his edge, and turned his inclinations towards Chriſtianity. But though he had loſt his Father, his Mother
<note n="c" place="margin">

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60969:169"/>By one of which, who was appointed to teach him the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, as a neceſſary piece of noble and ingenious education, he was perſuaded to the ſtudy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, as what would be a mighty advantage to him in what way ſoever he ſhould make uſe of his Rhetorical Studies afterwards. And the man himſelf being no inconſiderable Lawyer, read Lectures to him with great accuracy and diligence, which he as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſly attended to, rather to gratifie his humour and his fanſie, then out of any love to thoſe Studies, or deſign to arrive at perfection in them. Which however ſufficiently commends his induſtry, thoſe Laws (as himſelf obſerves
<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 171.</note>) being vaſt and various, and not to be learned without trouble and difficulty. And which above all encreaſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was, that they were all written in <hi>Latin,</hi> a Language (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes) great indeed and admirable, and ſuited to the Majeſty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but which he found troubleſom enough to make himſelf but a competent Maſter of.</p>

And even in ſecular cauſes, where the caſe was any thing knotty and difficult, it was uſually brought to him, whoſe ſentence was accounted more juſt and impartial, more firm and valid then any other deciſion whatſoever. It happened that two Brothers were at Law about a Lake, which both challenged as belonging to that part of their inheritance their Father had left them. The Umpirage of the caſe was left to him, who by all the perſuaſive arts of inſinuation firſt endeavoured to reconcile them, and peaceably to accommodate the difference between them. But his pains proved fruitleſs and ineffectual, the young men ſtormed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved each to maintain his right by force of Arms, and a day was ſet when they were to try their titles by all the power which their tenants of each ſide could bring into the field. To prevent which the holy Biſhop went the night before to the place, where he continued all night in the exerciſes of devotion, and by his prayers to Heaven procured the Lake to be turned into a parcel of dry and ſolid ground, removing thereby the bone of contention that was between them, the remains of which Lake were ſhewed many Ages after.

They preſently defended themſelves with this Book, whereupon he began more cloſely to join iſſue with them, continuing with them three days together from morning to night, weighing and diſcuſſing the doctrins contained in it. In all which time he admired their conſtancy and love to truth, their great quickneſs and readineſs of underſtanding, with ſo much order and decency, ſo much modeſty and moderation were the Diſcourſes managed on both ſides, doubts propounded, and aſſent yielded. For they took an eſpecial care not pertinaciouſly to defend their former opinions, when once they found them to be erroneous, nor to ſhun any objections which on either part were made againſt them. As near as might be they kept to the
